(A rock that gives mushrooms when you hit it? Sure, why not?)&nbsp; You can also choose to have the node restock after a delay or gradually over time.</p>\n\n<h2>Update: HUD Controller</h2>\n\n<p>The HUD controller now has Team and Class support, allowing you to create different HUD setups for each individual Team and Class, ideal for asymmetric game modes or contextual HUD layouts.&nbsp; Want to hide the HUD just for players in a specific area? Now you can set everyone in the area to a specific Class and then change the HUD just for them, leaving everyone else in the game unaffected.</p>\n\n<h2>Update: Teleporter Linking</h2>\n\n<p>Teleporters can now be linked together allowing for two-way travel. This can be used along with randomized teleport targets to create a ‚Äòdifferent every time‚Äô map layout which is random when a player first goes through the teleporter but then remains constant for the rest of the game (or until the link is broken via Channels).</p>\n\n<h2>Other Feature Updates</h2>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">Class support has been added to the Beacon device.</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">Added Old Cartoon filter to the My Island Camera Filter settings.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Prefab &amp; Gallery Updates</h2>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">Added the Resources Gallery - A variety of new STW props that work nicely with some of the Consumable Resources.</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">Added some new basketball assets to the Sports Gallery.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Prefab &amp; Gallery Fixes</h2>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">Fixed some collision issues with assets in the Elemental Cube Gallery.</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">Fixed an issue with football goals spawning when destroying the sports fields from the Sports Gallery.</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">Fixed an issue with the ivy, from Princess Castle Tower prefab, giving the wrong resource materials.</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">Fixed an issue with planter props, from The Sanctuary set, with giving no resource materials.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Consumables Updates</h2>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">Added some New Consumables to coincide with the New Resources Gallery.\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li aria-level=\"2\">Rainbow Crystal</li>\n\t\t<li aria-level=\"2\">Honey</li>\n\t\t<li aria-level=\"2\">Vindertech Mechanical Parts</li>\n\t\t<li aria-level=\"2\">Blue Mushroom</li>\n\t\t<li aria-level=\"2\">Pink Mushroom</li>\n\t\t<li aria-level=\"2\">Red Mushroom</li>\n\t\t<li aria-level=\"2\">White Mushroom</li>\n\t\t<li aria-level=\"2\">Yellow Mushroom</li>\n\t\t<li aria-level=\"2\">Spectrolite Ore</li>\n\t\t<li aria-level=\"2\">Spectral Twine</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Device Fixes</h2>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">Tracker Device\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li aria-level=\"2\">Previously if you attempted to add multiplayer players to the tracker simultaneously, only one would get added.

And flick stick too!<br />\n<br />\nYou may be thinking: ‚ÄúDoesn‚Äôt Fortnite already have gyro controls?‚Äù While it‚Äôs true that Fortnite on Nintendo Switch and Android had gyro-based motion controls, we‚Äôve added more robust gyro controls to Fortnite on Nintendo Switch, Android, PlayStation 4 and 5, and PC with v19.30! Read on to learn more about these controls, but first, check out this explainer video made by Jibb:&nbsp;</p>\n\n<div class=\"embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"true\" class=\"embed-responsive-item\" frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/CiSS5OsNCNU?rel=0\" width=\"100%\"></iframe></div>\n\n<h2><br />\nGyro Settings Summary</h2>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Fortnite Gyro Touch and Motion Controls\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-gyro-touch-and-motion-controls-3240x1946-4366b6d6ab09.png\" /></p>\n\n<h3><br />\nHow to Enable Gyro (And What This Does)</h3>\n\n<p>Enable or disable gyro controls in the ‚ÄúTouch and Motion‚Äù tab of the settings. Do this by toggling ‚ÄúGyro Aiming‚Äù to either on or off. When on, you‚Äôll be able to control the camera by turning the controller. This can offer more precision than standard stick aiming, but it doesn‚Äôt have to replace it entirely ‚Äî usually, players will still use the right stick for most camera control while using gyro aiming for finer adjustments that are difficult to do with a thumbstick.&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nYou‚Äôll notice more gyro options in the Touch and Motion section. Let‚Äôs go over them!</p>\n\n<h3><br />\nActive Mode: Choose When Gyro‚Äôs Active</h3>\n\n<p>There are two separate ‚ÄúActive Mode‚Äù settings. ‚ÄúActive Mode (Combat)‚Äù refers to when you want gyro active while you‚Äôre in combat, while ‚ÄúActive Mode (Building)‚Äù refers to when you want gyro active while building or editing. Here are the selections for both!<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\n<strong>Active Mode (Combat)</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><strong>Scope Only</strong>: Gyro active only when aiming scoped weapons.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><strong>Scope or Aiming</strong>: Gyro active when aiming any weapon.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><strong>Scope, Aiming, Harvesting</strong>: Gyro active when aiming any weapon or swinging your Harvesting Tool.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><strong>Always</strong>: Gyro active whether or not you‚Äôre aiming a weapon or swinging your Harvesting Tool.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><br />\n<strong>Active Mode (Building)</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><strong>None</strong>: Gyro active neither when building or editing.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><strong>Editing</strong>: Gyro active when editing but not building.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><strong>Always</strong>: Gyro active when either building or editing.&nbsp;</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<br />\nIf you set either Active Mode to Always, it‚Äôs a good idea to have another way to disable gyro so you can reset your controller position. You can do this by setting the ‚ÄúLook Stick Effect‚Äù option (explained next) to ‚ÄúDisables‚Äù or, in the controller customization settings, customizing your controls to include a ‚ÄúGyro Modifier‚Äù button.<br />\n<br />\nOn Android, a simple way to make sure you can control when gyro is active is by using the ‚ÄúTouch Effect‚Äù option. This lets you either enable or disable gyro while you are touching the look region of the screen.</p>\n\n<h3><br />\nLook Stick Effect: What the Right Stick Does to Gyro</h3>\n\n<p>Choose the effect your right stick stick has on gyro! If you set ‚ÄúLook Stick Effect‚Äù to ‚ÄúNone,‚Äù using (or not using) the right stick has no effect on gyro. If you set it to ‚ÄúDisables,‚Äù using the right stick will disable gyro. This is helpful for repositioning your controller without moving the camera.&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nSetting Look Stick Effect to ‚ÄúEnables‚Äù makes it so that gyro will be enabled while you‚Äôre using the right stick, even if it wouldn‚Äôt normally be active with your chosen Active Mode selections. This doesn‚Äôt turn off gyro when <strong>not</strong> using the right stick.</p>\n\n<h3><br />\nSensitivity Sliders and Selections</h3>\n\n<p>As you‚Äôd expect, you‚Äôre able to adjust the gyro sensitivity. (You can adjust the ratio of vertical to horizontal sensitivity too.) When set to the default 1.0, the camera will move the same amount as the controller. ‚ÄúAcceleration‚Äù (set to 2X by default) increases your sensitivity when you turn the controller quickly. To help keep your aim steady, zooming in will make the camera turn more slowly. (This zoom scaling can be disabled in the ‚ÄúAdvanced Gyro Options.‚Äù)<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nAcceleration can be customized or disabled. Turning up Acceleration lets you turn the camera more quickly when turning the controller quickly, even if you keep your sensitivity low. Disabling Acceleration keeps your camera turns precisely in proportion to your controller turns, regardless of how quickly you're moving the controller. (There‚Äôs also \"Legacy‚Äù Acceleration for those who prefer the feel of the motion acceleration from before&nbsp;v19.30.)</p>\n\n<h3><br />\nMore Gyro Options</h3>\n\n<p>Also in the Touch and Motion tab, players can control their aim steadiness when keeping their controller nearly still, as well as turn flick stick (explained below) on or off. For the most serious of gyro users, turn on ‚ÄúAdvanced Gyro Options‚Äù to unlock a bunch more settings, like changing your axes of rotation or even having a button to invert your gyro aim on the fly!</p>\n\n<h2><br />\nBring in Flick Stick!</h2>\n\n<p>We‚Äôve added flick stick to complement the gyro experience! Found in the ‚ÄúTouch and Motion‚Äù tab as well, turn on flick stick so that when you point the right stick in a certain direction, the camera will quickly flick to face that direction. Since this means you can no longer aim up or down with the right stick, this requires gyro aiming to be enabled.&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nFlick stick is generally recommended for experienced gyro players, but some new gyro players get a hold of it quickly.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2><br />\nFortnite Gyro Tips</h2>\n\n<p>Interested in playing Fortnite with gyro? Here are some tips from Jibb himself!<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nFor <strong>new gyro players</strong>, we recommend enabling gyro and not adjusting any other gyro settings (except sensitivities if you feel the need to change them). We also recommend keeping flick stick off. With gyro enabled and other settings at default, gyro is only active when aiming. This way, it simply adds onto traditional stick aiming, giving you a chance to get used to what gyro‚Äôs best at: fine aiming adjustments.<br />\n<br />\nFor <strong>experienced gyro players</strong>, we recommend setting your aim mode to Always and binding another input to disable gyro. A simple way to do this without losing controller real estate is to combine it with another input. For example, you can set Crouch / Slide&nbsp;and Gyro Modifier&nbsp;(which disables gyro) to the same button, then activate either one depending on how long you press the button.&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\n<img alt=\"Fortnite Setting Crouch / Slide and Gyro Modifier to the Same Button\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-setting-crouch-slide-and-gyro-modifier-to-the-same-button-3240x1950-1b9e9ead78a9.png\" /><br />\n<br />\nFor <strong>players who want to give flick stick a go</strong>, we recommend setting your Look Stick Effect to Enables. This way, even in an aim mode in which gyro is not active all the time, you can still make vertical adjustments when you need to by engaging the flick stick.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2><br />\nFortnite Gyro FAQ</h2>\n\n<h3><br />\nWhich platforms can I use gyro in Fortnite on?</h3>\n\n<p>Gyro in Fortnite is available on gyro-supported platforms. These are platforms whose control methods allow for gyro. Players can use gyro in Fortnite on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and 5, PC, and Android.&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nPlease note that gyro is unavailable when playing Fortnite through GeForce NOW on PC or mobile.<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<hr />\n<h3><br />\nWhat controllers can I use gyro with in Fortnite?</h3>\n\n<p>On <strong>Nintendo Switch</strong>, players can use gyro with the Joy-Con controllers (including in Handheld Mode) or the Pro Controller.<br />\n<br />\nOn <strong>PlayStation and PC</strong>, players can use gyro with the DualShock 4 (PlayStation 4) controller or the DualSense (PlayStation 5) controller.<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nOn <strong>Android</strong>, players can use gyro with the built-in mobile controls.<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<hr />\n<h3><br />\nCan I still use aim assist while using gyro?</h3>\n\n<p>Having Gyro Aiming on disables aim assist whenever gyro is active.&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<hr />\n<h3><br />\nWhat game modes is gyro supported in?</h3>\n\n<p>Gyro is supported in all three Fortnite game modes: Battle Royale, Creative, and Save the World.<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<hr />\n<h3><br />\nWhat‚Äôs the difference between ‚Äúgyro controls‚Äù and the ‚Äúmotion controls‚Äù that gyro controls replaced on Nintendo Switch on Android?</h3>\n\n<p>The gyro controls are an improved version of the motion controls that were in Fortnite on Nintendo Switch and Android before v19.30. While these motion controls were gyro-based, the new gyro controls have added benefits. These include significantly more customization (as seen in the settings rundown above), no forced aim acceleration, the ability to make gyro inactive in certain situations, and on Nintendo Switch specifically: less frequent recalibration.&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nWhen it comes to sensitivity, there is now less need to set different sensitivities depending on whether you‚Äôre sniping or targeting, since the main sensitivity slider is now scaled by zoom level. However, players can disable zoom scaling in the Advanced Gyro Options, as well as set specific sensitivities for sniping, targeting (now ‚Äúaiming‚Äù), harvesting, building, and editing.&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p><br />\nHave more ways to play than before in Fortnite!</p>\n","description":"Made in collaboration with input specialist and flick stick creator Julian \"Jibb‚Äù Smart, new and improved gyro controls have been added to Fortnite on gyro-supported platforms!","date":"2022-02-15T07:30:00.000Z","trending":false,"images":{"image":"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/19br-gyrocontrolsasset-newsthumb-576x576-80a0929f4366.jpg","share":"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/19br-gyrocontrolsasset-social-1920x1080-1920x1080-8e81d712bae6.jpg","trending":"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-gyro-aiming-and-flick-stick-controls-1900x600-e539e76b8309.jpg"},"author":"The Fortnite Team","url":"https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/blog/gyro-aiming-and-flick-stick-come-to-fortnite-in-v19-30-more-controller-options","nextPost":"https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/blog/save-the-worlds-newest-update-2-15-2022","prevPost":"https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/blog/load-into-the-lobby-in-fortnite-game-mode-select-screen-removed"},{"id":"29742ca0-46b4-4f01-9d2f-8d88cfbd21d2","title":"Load into the Lobby in Fortnite - Game Mode Select Screen Removed","content":"<p>With this week‚Äôs v19.30 update, we‚Äôve removed the initial game screen (which appeared on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC) where players would select either Save the World, Battle Royale, or Creative.

Navigate its central waterway and harvest materials from its many facilities.<br />\n<br />\nRumor has it that Covert Cavern is home to a <strong>Mythic version of the Stinger SMG</strong>, possessing more power than a regular one (and more recoil to match). However, getting your hands on it is no easy feat‚Ä¶<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"Fortnite Mythic Stinger SMG\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-mythic-stinger-smg-1900x600-fa6d41066033.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<h2><br />\nHeavy Shotgun Returns with Heavy Updates</h2>\n\n<p>The <strong>Heavy Shotgun</strong> has been unvaulted in a refashioned form for Chapter 3. It‚Äôs now single slug, longer-range, and requires more accuracy. Exceptionally reliable and consistent, break out the Heavy for closing the gap or responding to an incoming threat!<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"Fortnite Heavy Shotgun\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-heavy-shotgun-1900x600-5d901f3cb041.jpg\" style=\"height:auto; width:auto\" /><br />\n<br />\nFind the Heavy Shotgun on the ground, in normal and Rare Chests, and from Supply Drops. The new Heavy Shotgun is available in all rarities.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nNote: The new Heavy Shotgun is unable to penetrate through multiple targets, which the classic Heavy could do. This is a bug that will be fixed in a future game update.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2><br />\nHaven Un-unmasked!</h2>\n\n<p>With v19.20, begin unlocking all the masks of Chapter 3 Season 1 Battle Pass Outfit <strong>Haven</strong>!<br />\n<br />\n<em>How</em> do you unlock Haven‚Äôs masks? Collect Feathers in Chests around the Island, then spend your Feathers in the ‚ÄúHaven‚Äôs Masks‚Äù section of the Battle Pass tab. Each mask has a special Quest for you to complete to make the mask available to redeem. For example, catch fish to unlock cat masks, forage to unlock deer masks, glide to unlock owl masks, and more!&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"Fortnite Haven Reanimated Cat Mask, Autumn Stag Mask, Tropical Owl Mask, and Snow Hunter Mask\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-haven-reanimated-cat-mask-autumn-stag-mask-tropical-owl-mask--and-snow-hunter-mask-1900x600-e322e2be6a83.jpg\" /><br />\n<br />\nEach mask‚Äôs Quest can be found in the ‚ÄúHaven‚Äôs Masks‚Äù Battle Pass section, and every mask is unlockable all the way ‚Äòtil the end of Chapter 3 Season 1. (Please note that players must own the Haven Outfit before starting the Quests.)</p>\n\n<h2><br />\nUpdate on XP in Creative</h2>\n\n<p>We‚Äôre improving the XP Beyond Battle Royale experience! Usually, Creative Islands undergo ‚Äúcalibration‚Äù before they begin granting Battle Pass XP from your in-game Accolades (sometimes taking several days). Now with v19.20, if you triggered an Accolade before calibration was complete, you‚Äôll be rewarded with the XP once it‚Äôs available!<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"Fortnite XP\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-xp-1900x600-0e2d9554aa11.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<h2><br />\nForecast Update&nbsp;</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/news/fortnite-battle-royale-v19-01-jan-11-hotfix-tornadoes-and-lightning-crop-up\">Tornado and lightning weather events</a> have been added to Team Rumble!</p>\n\n<h2><br />\nCompetitive Notes</h2>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>The Mythic Stinger SMG is not included in competitive playlists. The Heavy Shotgun is included immediately, however.</p>\n\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>\n\t\t<p>While most new/unvaulted items are given an evaluation period in the wild before being added to competitive playlists, we‚Äôve made an exception with the Heavy Shotgun, as the new Heavy Shotgun was made with higher-skill play in-mind.</p>\n\t\t</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>As our heads-up stated last week, Spider-Man‚Äôs Web-Shooters now have 20 shots instead of 80 in competitive playlists. This lower count is to encourage more strategic decisions about when to use the item, while retaining the item‚Äôs usefulness as a powerful mobility tool.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2><br />\nMajor Bug Fixes</h2>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Fixed an issue involving the visual indicator for using a Reboot Van appearing at a greater distance than the sound could be heard.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Fixed an issue involving matches sometimes not being recorded during a tournament session and the points earned in those&nbsp;matches becoming lost.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Fixed an issue involving Spider-Man‚Äôs Web-Shooters dropping from eliminated players with a full stock of uses even if they&nbsp;didn‚Äôt have a full stock before the player was eliminated.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n","description":"The Fortnite Battle Royale v19.20 update introduces Covert Cavern ‚Äì keeper of the Mythic Stinger ‚Äì and Haven‚Äôs masks.

XP earned during the calibration has been updated to allow players to earn XP even while an island is being calibrated! While players are battling it out for XP, creators can now really turn things up another level by enabling fire üî• in their islands.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Creators, remember the <a href=\"https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/creative/docs\">Fortnite Creative Documentation Site</a> is updated every patch with additional details, use cases, and thought starters for newly released and updated devices.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2>Accolade XP Calibration</h2>\n\n<p>Get ready to share the big news with your players, Creators. We‚Äôre improving the XP Beyond Battle Royale experience! As you know, Creative Experiences undergo ‚Äúcalibration‚Äù before they begin granting Battle Pass XP from your in-game Accolades. Now with v19.20, if a player has triggered an Accolade before calibration was complete, they‚Äôll be rewarded with XP once the Experience is calibrated!&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, Creators will be notified through email on the calibration status of their Experience.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3>Requirements&nbsp;</h3>\n\n<p>Players who previously participated in Creative Experiences while they were undergoing calibration within the last 30 days may be rewarded XP retroactively when these Experiences pass calibration.</p>\n\n<h3>Claiming Rewards</h3>\n\n<p>Players can claim their XP reward when they log into Fortnite.</p>\n\n<h2>New: Natural Forces - Fire</h2>\n\n<p>Fire is a force to be reckoned with and Creators now have the ability to enable fire effects in their experiences! We‚Äôre also bringing some new fire weapons from BR into Creative for the first time. We‚Äôll be adding additional ways to control fire in future updates.</p>\n\n<p>New Fire items:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">Primal Flame Bow</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">Flare Gun</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">Fireflies</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">Gas Can</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>New: Gas for Vehicles</h3>\n\n<p>Speed around the race track to beat that time trial but don't forget to fuel up! Creators who really want to spice up vehicles in their maps can now include Gas Cans and have them fuel the vehicles in their islands. We‚Äôve also added a configurable Fuel Pump device to let your players gas up and get going.</p>\n\n<h2>New: Skydive Volume</h2>\n\n<p>You may have felt the effects of the Skydive volume if you‚Äôve taken part in some of our previous music experiences, but now this device is available to everyone to send players flying! Create air elevators, wind tunnels and more as you experiment with all the cool features of this new device.</p>\n\n<p>For more details, we‚Äôve added the <a href=\"https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/creative/docs/using-skydive-volume-devices-in-fortnite-creative\">Skydive Volume to the Fortnite Creative Document site</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>New: Channel Number Text Entry</h2>\n\n<p>A small change but a massive one - you can now directly type in Channel numbers when setting up transmitters/receivers on all devices. Console players can benefit too with virtual keyboard support available on all devices. We‚Äôll be looking to roll out direct number entry support to other device options in future updates.</p>\n\n<h2>Update: Sentry Device</h2>\n\n<p>The Sentry is the latest device to be changed from a Trap device to a prop. But that‚Äôs not all, we‚Äôve added a whole bunch of features to the new version including adding Sentries to teams, a whole new Idle &gt; Alert &gt; Hostile system and a bunch of new transmitters and receivers to give Sentries a whole new lease on life.

A new option Custom Objective Text is also added to allow creators to <strong>customize the objective name text</strong> on HUD.</p>\n\n<h2>In Testing: AI Spawn Limit</h2>\n\n<p>We‚Äôve raised the maximum number of Fiends and Animals that can be spawned at once from 20 to 30 (of each type).&nbsp; We‚Äôll be monitoring performance impact and may increase or decrease that limit depending on the results.</p>\n\n<h2>Other Device Updates</h2>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">Button device now has a Class filter.</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">Some non-player-facing devices have had their in-world models updated.</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">Added the following new models to the Character device:\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li aria-level=\"2\">Dark Vanguard</li>\n\t\t<li aria-level=\"2\">Dark Voyager</li>\n\t\t<li aria-level=\"2\">Robo-Ray</li>\n\t\t<li aria-level=\"2\">Shiver</li>\n\t\t<li aria-level=\"2\">Infinity</li>\n\t\t<li aria-level=\"2\">Gia</li>\n\t\t<li aria-level=\"2\">Zero</li>\n\t\t<li aria-level=\"2\">Snow Drift</li>\n\t\t<li aria-level=\"2\">Snow Heart</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">Added the following weapons to the Creative inventory:\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li aria-level=\"2\">Heavy Shotgun</li>\n\t\t<li aria-level=\"2\">Gunnar‚Äôs Stinger SMG</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Prefab &amp; Gallery Updates</h2>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">Added a Battle Bus to Variant Car Gallery B.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Prefab &amp; Gallery Fixes</h2>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">Fixed an issue that caused multiple assets in the Sanctuary Prop Gallery to display the wrong material or give the wrong resource material.</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">Fixed an issue with a doorway prop from Sanctuary Prop Gallery with being able to see through the asset.</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">Fixed an issue where some logs or stumps from the Nature Snow Gallery would not drop resource materials.</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">Fixed an issue with the Tan Cliff Cave Gallery not spawning in the correct cliff materials.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Device Fixes</h2>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">Item Remover: Apply to Team/Class filters now work appropriately.</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">Fixed an issue that caused the round setting device to trigger the start of a round even when disabled.&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">Fixed an issue with the Save Point device that caused it to lose ‚ÄúCollide with terrain‚Äù settings after being copy/pasted.</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">Fixed an issue that caused the Barrier Device to have a larger hitbox than intended.</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">Fixed an issue with the Signal Remote that caused it to not trigger the primary or secondary channel correctly.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Island Fixes</h2>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">Fixed an issue that caused personal XL islands settings to be overwritten by featured XL islands.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Gameplay Fixes</h2>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">Players no longer return to hub after getting eliminated during game in creative game mode.</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">Fixed an issue that caused players to spawn in the sky when using the Driftboard.</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">Fixed an issue that caused boats to jitter on the water surface when vacant.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>UI Fixes</h2>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">Quick Menu -&gt; Objective Placement -&gt; Building As Prop is now set as OFF by default for new Creative players.</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">Fixed an issue that caused the Scoreboard to not display correctly.</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">Fixed an issue with the Item Granter device not having a ‚ÄúPersistence‚Äù sorting tag.</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">Fixed an issue with Skye‚Äôs Grappler having a blurry UI icon.</li>\n</ul>\n","description":"The Fortnite Creative v19.20 Brings an update to calibration XP, Fire, gas for vehicles and more!

Content that condones or incites violence against others has no place here.</div>\n\n<div style=\"margin-left:40px\"><br />\n1.2&nbsp;<strong>Keep Personal Info To Yourself -</strong> To help avoid deceptive practices (phishing, buying/selling account information), do not disclose or request personal information through Island messaging.<br />\n<br />\n1.3<strong>&nbsp;Intolerance and Discrimination</strong> - Fortnite welcomes diversity in race, ethnicity, color, religion, gender identity, sexual orientation, ability, national origin, and other groups. Content should not demean, marginalize, use hateful language against, or belittle other users or groups.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n1.4<strong>&nbsp;Love‚Ä¶ Don‚Äôt Hate</strong> - Don‚Äôt create content that includes hateful symbols or depictions or content that glorifies or incites violence.<br />\n<br />\n1.5<strong>&nbsp;Bullying and Harassment</strong> - Respect others that participate in your creation. Interacting with others in a way that is predatory, threatening, intimidating, lewd, demeaning, derogatory, invasive of privacy, or abusive is against the rules.<br />\n<br />\n1.6&nbsp;<strong>Give Credit Where It‚Äôs Due</strong> - Don‚Äôt impersonate other users, streamers, celebrities, government officials, Epic employees, or anyone else. And don‚Äôt take credit for another user‚Äôs creation. Pretending to be someone else in order to deceive or defraud others is not okay.<br />\n<br />\n1.7&nbsp;<strong>Play By The Rules</strong> - Do not create Islands that promote the use of known cheats, exploits, glitched items, server crashes, and bugs. Do not use your island as a way to scam other players, including dishonest practices, such as exploiting the Support-A-Creator program or featuring clickbait advertisements.<br />\n<br />\n1.8&nbsp;<strong>Appropriate Language Only</strong> - Don‚Äôt name your island or include on your island obscene text or symbols, nor spelling variations, or visual depictions of text aimed at evading these rules.<br />\n<br />\n1.9&nbsp;<strong>All Bets Are Off</strong> - Don‚Äôt implement gambling, raffles, or casino-style games that involve real money or V-Bucks.<br />\n<br />\n1.10 <strong>Keep It On The Island</strong> - Do not include offsite web links anywhere on your Island. Note: Promotion of social media handles/channels on the following platforms is fine provided they are not accompanied by a URL.<br />\n<br />\n1.11 <strong>Keep It Fortnite</strong>: When promoting your experience inside Fortnite, the assets (such as thumbnail images or videos) you use to represent your Fortnite experience must look and feel like Fortnite: you must not mislead players as to the sort of experience they will receive. You may not incorporate photographs.<br />\n<br />\n1.12 <strong>Stay Within Spec Guidelines</strong> - Make sure the Islands you‚Äôre creating do not cause server issues -- intentionally or not. Framerates should stay above 30 FPS. Use your best judgment!<br />\n<br />\n1.13 <strong>Align with the Game Rating</strong> - Fortnite is a teen-rated title (ESRB Teen 13+, PEGI 12+). Do not create content that isn‚Äôt appropriate for a teen audience. For example, content ‚Äúmade for kids‚Äù or ‚Äúadult content‚Äù (no nursery rhymes, no pole dancing).</div>\n\n<h3 role=\"presentation\">2 Working With Others</h3>\n\n<div style=\"margin-left:40px\">2.1 If you engage another Builder to help you build your experience, or similarly, if you agree to help another Builder create their experience, it is an agreement between you and that party.

The Escalation Modifier is as simple as it is effective, here is a rundown of how it works; as your Commanders‚Äô elimination streaks climb, your team will receive a small boost to bonus damage (capping out at a 100% increase). In addition, reaching elimination streaks will trigger an Elemental Burst at all Commanders‚Äô locations, dealing damage and unleashing additional effects!<br />\n<br />\n<strong>30 Eliminations: <em>Nature Burst</em></strong> - Mother Nature is on your side! This burst damages and stuns surrounding enemies for <strong>3 seconds</strong>.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>60 Eliminations: <em>Fire Burst</em></strong> - Is it getting hot in here or is that just your elimination streak? This burst will deal damage and apply a blistering debuff which causes damage <strong>every second</strong>.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>90 Eliminations</strong>:<strong>&nbsp;<em>D</em><em>ance Party</em></strong> - Make em‚Äô dance! This burst deals damage, refills Commander‚Äôs energy, and last but certainly not least, causes the Husks to dance for <strong>7 seconds</strong>.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>120 Eliminations: <em>Ice Burst</em></strong> - After heating them up with some fire and dancing, it‚Äôs time to cool them down! This burst will deal damage and freeze nearby targets for <strong>5 seconds.</strong><br />\n<br />\n<strong>150 Eliminations: <em>Energy Burst</em></strong><em> </em>- And now it‚Äôs time to unleash the power! This burst will damage and cause nearby enemies to take increased damage for <strong>10 seconds.</strong><br />\n<br />\nKeep in mind, if you lose your streak your Escalation bonuses will reset. So keep it moving and take out as many Husks as you can as fast as you can!<br />\n&nbsp;\n<h3><img alt=\"Fortnite Save The World Wargames Jpg\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-save-the-world-wargames-jpg-1920x1080-4504507fc9e4.jpg\" style=\"height:auto; width:auto\" /></h3>\n&nbsp;\n\n<h3><strong>Wargames</strong></h3>\nMajor Oswald will do anything to sharpen up the security of Homebase, even if it means putting Commanders and their base through the wringer!

Until now! And it‚Äôs actually no ‚Äúit‚Äù‚Äî there‚Äôs more than one stomping around the Island. Don‚Äôt worry, though. Despite their enormous size, these creatures called <strong>Klombos</strong> are completely peaceful. (Unless provoked, but still.)&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nHow can these gentle giants help you in battle? Ascend their tails to get to the blowhole on their heads, then get launched a great distance upwards to escape a tricky situation. They‚Äôve also been known to sneeze out items after snacking a bit!</p>\n\n<h2><br />\nKlomberry Irresistible</h2>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Fortnite Klomberry\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-klomberry-1920x1080-ab74245c6b23.jpg\" style=\"height:auto; width:auto\" /><br />\n<br />\nThe Klombo diet is very diverse ‚Äî they‚Äôll eat just about anything you throw in front of them. But what they love most is <strong>Klomberries</strong>! Pick these fruits from small bushes around the Island, then throw one near a Klombo to lead it your way. Remember: after Klombos snack a bit, items spout out! Have you accidentally (or purposefully‚Ä¶) provoked a Klombo? Calm its rage with none other than a Klomberry.<br />\n<br />\nFun fact: Klomberries also have nutritional value for non-Klombos. Consume one for a bump in Effective Health!&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2><br />\nThe Return of Tilted Towers</h2>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Fortnite Tilted Towers\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-tilted-towers-1920x1080-ad94e5f0b016.jpg\" style=\"height:auto; width:auto\" /><br />\n<br />\nThe Island‚Äôs thaw goes on, and <strong>Tilted Towers</strong> has emerged from underneath the snow and ice! Go out on the town with this classic POI from Fortnite‚Äôs past: build to the top of its iconic clock tower, bust into apartments, stop by restaurants, battle it out in the underground parking garage, storm No Sweat Insurance‚Äôs office, and more on your urban excursion.</p>\n\n<h2><br />\nGrenade Launcher Unvaulted and Adjusted</h2>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Fortnite Grenade Launcher\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-grenade-launcher-1900x600-8697c8897b89.jpg\" style=\"height:auto; width:auto\" /><br />\n<br />\nThe <strong>Grenade Launcher</strong> is back and we've made some tweaks to its responsiveness! Projectiles now explode after their first bounce and fire more directly at your target.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nYou can find Grenade Launchers from Rare Chests, Supply Drops, and‚Ä¶ sharks.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2><br />\nYou Dropped This üëë</h2>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Fortnite Victory Crown\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-victory-crown-1900x600-ca4724a17dd4.jpg\" style=\"height:auto; width:auto\" /><br />\n<br />\nWith v19.10, the Crowning Achievement Emote now displays more than 99 Crowned Victory Royales.

The Real Time clock, Map/Scoreboard, Creative Name Tags, Creature Manager&nbsp;all receive updates. We‚Äôve also added some awesome new devices including the Prop Manipulator, Player Counter, and the Pop-up Dialog device.</p>\n\n<p>Creators, as a reminder the <a href=\"https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/creative/docs\">Fortnite Creative Documentation Site</a> is updated with additional details, use cases, and thought starters for newly released &nbsp;and updated devices.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Note: </strong>With 19.10 we've introduced a new feature called Contextual Filtering. This feature hides or displays options depending on the values selected for certain related options. For example, on the new Prop Manipulation device, when the Affects All Objects option is set to In a Zone, three additional options display that allow you to set the Height, Width and Depth of the zone. This feature is added to just a few devices in this release, but we will be adding it to other devices in future updates. This feature will reduce clutter in the Customize panel and make options easier to manage and navigate.</p>\n\n<h2>New: Prop Manipulator device</h2>\n\n<p>Possibly one of the most requested features ever - this device provides the ability to <strong>manipulate the visibility and collision of props</strong>, as well as override their health values and send signals when they get damaged or destroyed. Simply attach the device to a single prop or make it into a volume to encompass any number of props and you can toggle the visibility of those props with transmitters as well as perform a few other nifty functions.</p>\n\n<p>We plan to add more features to the Prop Manipulator in future releases to give you even more control over your worlds.</p>\n\n<p>For more details, we‚Äôve added the <a href=\"https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/creative/docs/using-prop-manipulation-devices-in-fortnite-creative\">Prop Manipulation device to the Fortnite Creative Documentation site</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>New: Icon Library</h2>\n\n<p>We‚Äôve added a new library of 90 icons that can be attached to various devices to add some flavor and context to your experiences.&nbsp; These can be used to show points of interest on the map, lead players to specific areas or objects, or give context to devices like the Capture Area.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>We‚Äôll be adding new icons to the library and adding icon support to more devices in future updates.</p>\n\n<p>The devices which can utilize the Icon Library from this release are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">Accolade Device</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">Beacons</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">Capture Area</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">Explosive Device</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">Map Marker</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">Player Counter</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">Ball Spawner</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>We had hoped to include support for the Objective Device gallery in this initial release, but it proved a little more tricky than expected, so you can expect it to be added in an upcoming release in the near future.</p>\n\n<h2>New: Player Counter device</h2>\n\n<p>The Player Counter device provides two major new features to empower Creators to control the flow and balance of games:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">It allows you to check how many players are in a specific area (with optional team and class filters), compare it against a target number and then send a signal based on whether it passes or fails the comparison.</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">It allows a signal to be sent whenever a player joins or leaves a game in progress.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>There are a whole bunch of different options and subtle tweaks that make this device extremely powerful, so be sure to check out the full documentation for it and spend some time experimenting to unlock its full potential.</p>\n\n<p>For more details, we‚Äôve added the <a href=\"https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/creative/docs/using-player-counter-devices-in-fortnite-creative\">Player Counter device to the Fortnite Creative Documentation site</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>New: Pop-up Dialog Device</h2>\n\n<p>The Pop-up Dialog device allows you to display information to players in a completely new way! With up to two customizable button responses and the option to use simple markup within the text, you can now create information boxes and tutorials, or link dialogs together to create branching choices.</p>\n\n<p>We plan to add more customization options to the Pop-up Dialog device in future releases.</p>\n\n<p>Here are the markup codes you can currently use in the dialog text to format it:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">&lt;cr&gt; - moves the text to a new line (Body text only)</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">{playername} - displays the name of the player viewing the dialog.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>For more details, we‚Äôve added the <a href=\"https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/creative/docs/using-popup-dialog-devices-in-fortnite-creative\">Pop-up Dialog device to the Fortnite Creative Documentation site</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Update: Real Time Clock</h2>\n\n<p>Get your event countdown ready! We‚Äôre updating the Real Time Clock device with two heavily requested features:&nbsp;</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">You can now set the RTC to automatically repeat at set intervals of hours, days, weeks or months - a specified number of times or even infinitely.</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">You can now define a duration for the clock and have a transmitter fire when the duration elapses.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>We‚Äôve updated our <a href=\"https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/creative/docs/using-real-time-clock-devices-in-fortnite-creative\">Fortnite Creative Real Time Clock Device documentation</a> with the details you need to set yourself up for running an event using the Real Time Clock.</p>\n\n<h2>Update: Creature Manager</h2>\n\n<p>Another heavily requested feature from the community: the Creature Manager device can now be enabled and disabled via channels, allowing you to easily create ramping difficulty levels by switching between managers during a game.</p>\n\n<h2>Update: Map/Scoreboard</h2>\n\n<p>We‚Äôve updated the map and scoreboard to make it possible to view both screens in one location and to remove the necessity for map and scoreboard display to be an either/or option in the settings. The Map Screen Display setting in the My Island UI screen will determine which screen is shown by default when the player presses the Map key, but they will then be able to switch between the two using tabs at the top of the screen.</p>\n\n<p>If you don‚Äôt want players to be able to see the map for whatever reason, we‚Äôve added a Display Overview Map option - setting it to NO will simply show ‚ÄòMap Not Available‚Äô when players switch to the Map tab.</p>\n\n<h2>Update: Creative Name Tags</h2>\n\n<p>We‚Äôve added a number of new options to the My Island settings screen and Team Settings and Class Designer devices to provide more control over when and how player name tags are displayed to help Creators cut down on visual noise during their experiences.</p>\n\n<p>The old Player Names &amp; Location option has now been renamed to Always Show Name Plates and the values have been renamed slightly:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">Team Only &gt; Always Show to Team</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">Always Show &gt; Always Show to All</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">Always Hide &gt; Always Hide (No change)</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">No (New option)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>When set to ALWAYS SHOW TO TEAM, friendly players will always be able to see your Name Plate, but enemies will follow the rules set with the new options we‚Äôve added.</p>\n\n<p>When set to NO, Name Plates will be shown to or hidden from all players based on the rules set by the new options:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">Name Plate Max Distance\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li aria-level=\"2\">Causes Name Plates to be hidden if a player is too far away from an observer.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">Name Plate Line of Sight\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li aria-level=\"2\">Requires an observer to have an unobstructed line of sight to see a Name Plate.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">Focus For Name Plates\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li aria-level=\"2\">Requires an observer to actually focus on a player to see their Name Plate using the following parameters:&nbsp;</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">Focus Angle\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li aria-level=\"2\">Requires a player to be within this angle of an observer‚Äôs reticle to display the Name Plate.&nbsp; Only functional if Focus For Name Plates is set to ON.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">Focus Time\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li aria-level=\"2\">Requires a player to be within the Focus Angle for the specified length of time before their Name Plate becomes visible.&nbsp; Only functional if Focus For Name Plates is set to ON.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Other Device Updates</h2>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">HUD Controller device\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li aria-level=\"2\">The Map/Scoreboard button prompt can now be shown/hidden.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">Matchmaking Portal\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li aria-level=\"2\">Players playing in Private mode can now start the game manually before the pre-game countdown has elapsed.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">Switch device\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li aria-level=\"2\">Added unlit versions of the default model and Antique Lever model.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">VFX Device\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li aria-level=\"2\">Added Laserbeam effect from Party Royale.</li>\n\t\t<li aria-level=\"2\">Added Snow particle effect.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Prefab &amp;

Hey I‚Äôm not judging; I also like to kick my feet up and spend some time just enjoying a good tune once in a while‚Ä¶ But I don‚Äôt think Commanders can get away with that anymore. The Storm seems to have noticed this building technique, and has made adjustments against it; that's just freaky man!<br />\n<br />\nIt seems Husks that stay stuck on the field for a while will be reabsorbed by The Storm, and then replaced by new, fresh Husks. This must be a way The Storm keeps its Husks alert, active, and always ready to tear apart your structures.<br />\n<br />\nI don‚Äôt know what The Storm is feeding these Husks, but it sure seems to be working. Higher level Husk will have an easier time clawing through your defense, so watch out in those more difficult Zones.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nTo counter these buffed up Husks, we have strengthened our traps!&nbsp; Husks will no longer become immune to our control traps, no matter how many times you stun, snare or freeze 'em. What does Major Oswald like to say again? No Mercy?<br />\n<br />\nThis proves my theory that The Storm is smarter than we think so as our tactics change, so will The Storm‚Äôs.

The results? The designs of community members <strong>Ladiale</strong> (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/lbdart_\">@lbdart_</a>) and <strong>Alta</strong> (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/AltaCalls\">@AltaCalls</a>) blew us away!

I think they're majestic animals with a lot of prejudices and stigmas around them. I designed the concept based on the animal, having the little red riding hood in my mind too.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Alta:</strong> The idea of him being a frozen skeleton just came from my mind as I‚Äôve loved the previous skeleton skins in Fortnite and that's when my mind went click and smashed the two ideas together!<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<u><strong>How does it feel to win Concept Royale and to see your concept in Fortnite?</strong></u><br />\n<br />\n<strong>Ladiale:</strong> It's something I still can't believe. It feels like at any moment someone would just come and say there was a mistake, it's absolutely insane. But I'm grateful, it's not something I expected to happen at all and it inspires me to keep on creating and going on.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Alta:</strong> It‚Äôs honestly a dream come true for me. I‚Äôve always loved making characters in my own time and giving them all sorts of stories and designs. When I saw the contest I knew I had to enter it. I knew it would be tough with how much talent there is in this community and I wasn‚Äôt wrong. The [concepts] that came out of the contest were just incredible! Finally seeing one of my ideas and one of my own characters in Fortnite is a feeling I just can‚Äôt describe.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<u><strong>When did you first start creating Outfit concepts/become an artist?</strong></u><br />\n<br />\n<strong>Ladiale:</strong> Nalia was my first Outfit concept for Fortnite. It was my first time creating something for the community. Actually I had a lot of doubts and high expectations at the same time. But I've been a character designer and artist for many years now, I'm not professional at all, but I've been a self-taught artist since 2016. I always wanted to create my own stories and becoming an artist felt necessary.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Alta:</strong> I‚Äôve been doing art my whole life, but I moved into 3D art around the start of 2017! I always did it as a hobby and to make any idea that came into my head. I first started making Fortnite Outfit concepts around the summer of 2020 after my friend had pitched me a simple skin idea based on the Chaos Agent Outfit!&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<u><strong>What is your favorite thing about Fortnite?</strong></u><br />\n<br />\n<strong>Ladiale:</strong> My favorite thing is the experience to share and create experiences with other players, the artistic direction, the vivid colors, and the huge diversity of designs and items.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Alta:</strong> It‚Äôs really hard to say as there‚Äôs just so much I love about this game, but if I had to pick one thing I would have to say the story. It feels so special to me and so unique. I love seeing all these different events transpire and reacting to them with my friends.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<u><strong>Which element from your concept do you feel represents you the most?</strong></u><br />\n<br />\n<strong>Ladiale:</strong> That's a hard question to answer, but I'd say the mask and the mantle. In the past I used to represent my avatars with mantles of the same fashion.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Alta:</strong> I would have to say the whole idea of this [concept] being based around a cowboy. I‚Äôve always loved western movies and shows and I‚Äôve always loved characters that are designed around that theme.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<u><strong>How would you describe your concept in three short words?</strong></u><br />\n<br />\n<strong>Ladiale:</strong> Oniric, vibrant, encouraging<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Alta:</strong> Vengeful, cold, ruthless<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<u><strong>Tell us a fun fact about yourself!</strong></u><br />\n<br />\n<strong>Ladiale:</strong> I wasn't going to take part in the contest in the first place, but a friend challenged me to do it for a gift! And well my boyfriend‚Äôs support was a key for all this.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Alta:</strong> I absolutely adore roguelike games!

We‚Äôve been looking into this area and seen fewer full matches than we‚Äôd expect. Some of these issues were bugs (and some have already been addressed), but others are a result of how we‚Äôre incentivizing creators.</p>\n\n<p>The current pre-game HUD ‚ÄòSupport Me‚Äô feature has been in use for a while and hasn‚Äôt proven itself. It doesn‚Äôt provide a consistent player experience across platforms, it isn‚Äôt part of the game world itself, and it's only fit for lobbies. That last point is particularly important, as it has ended up incentivizing the use of lobbies, even when the game mode would actually be better, with fuller matches, with Join In Progress enabled.</p>\n\n<p>We recognize that not all games and experiences benefit from Join in Progress, but if your map would benefit from it, we want you to be empowered to turn it on and have players experience your map at its best, without having to compromise on your support.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Fortnite Creative Support Device Jpg\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-creative-support-device-jpg-1920x1080-a659b9404ac2.png\" style=\"height:auto; width:auto\" /></p>\n\n<h2>Asking for Support: Rules</h2>\n\n<p>The only rule when asking players to support you, either by using the Support Device or using the pre-game ‚ÄúSupport Me‚Äù function is do not to force or trick players into supporting you. For example: by pretending the default ‚ÄúSupport Me‚Äù button does something else.</p>\n\n<h2>Support Device: Best Practices</h2>\n\n<p>When you use the Support Device, please consider these best practices.</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>You can place a Billboard device to draw attention to the Support Device. Please only use a maximum of the ‚ÄòMedium‚Äô font size (which is the default billboard font size).&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li>When using a billboard to encourage players to support you, please use one of the recommended billboard messages below, when creating your billboard. For solo creations use I, Me, my.&nbsp; For Team Maps use We, Us, our. Examples include:\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Press button to support Us</li>\n\t\t<li>Press button to support my/our creations.&nbsp;</li>\n\t\t<li>We appreciate your support by pressing this button.</li>\n\t\t<li>Thank you for the ongoing support.</li>\n\t\t<li>To support future creations, press this button</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>You can place decorations around the Support Device. You should not create arrows, hearts, or other obvious work to encourage or create advertisements of the support.</li>\n\t<li>You should allow for 2 full tiles of space between the Support Device and any player spawn or teleport devices. Remember not to make advertisement a player‚Äôs first experience, as per our <a href=\"https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/creative/docs/player-experience-best-practices-in-fortnite-creative\">best practices</a>.</li>\n\t<li>You‚Äôll find that the Support Device is limited to one per island. Consider placing it in a shared spawn hub, or a dedicated non-combat zone within the map, or in an appealing place in your experience.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Fortnite Creative Support Device Best Practices Jpg\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-creative-support-device-best-practices-jpg-1920x1080-3539b87cac7a.png\" style=\"height:auto; width:auto\" /></p>\n\n<h2>Support Device: Technical Restrictions</h2>\n\n<p>When using the Support Device, you will find the following technical restrictions:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">The Support Device is limited to one per island.</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">Resizing is disabled on the Support Device.</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">The Support Device will disable itself if it is overlapping another device. Make sure to place it carefully.</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">Pickups cannot be placed on or near the Support Device.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Using the ‚ÄúSupport Me‚Äù feature in pre-game lobbies</h2>\n\n<p>When you set the autostart option in the <a href=\"https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/creative/docs/fortnite-creative-glossary/#g\">Game settings</a> of your map to any value other than Immediate, your map will automatically start with a pre-game lobby. Players joining this lobby will see a ‚ÄúSupport Me‚Äù button on their HUD, inviting them to hit a button to set your code as their active Support-A-Creator code.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Some game modes benefit from pre-game lobbies, but not all. Instead of a pre-game lobby, consider setting autostart to immediate and instead use ‚Äòjoin in progress‚Äô.

Perhaps stop by the suburban <strong>Greasy Grove</strong>, the industrial <strong>Logjam Lumberyard</strong>, and other locales.<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"Fortnite Snow Biome\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-snow-biome-1920x1080-58a251012f12.jpg\" style=\"height:auto; width:auto\" /><br />\n<br />\nLike warmer weather? To the east are the tropics, with coastal keys, palm trees, and weathered sights to see. Although The Seven have outposts all throughout the Island, the tropics are home to <em>their</em> home, the ‚Äú<strong>Sanctuary</strong>.‚Äù This compound is right next to the coast, where you can get a clear view of the colossal rock statue of The Foundation. And speaking of colossal, the towering, web-covered <strong>Daily Bugle</strong> building is also in the area.<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"Fortnite Tropics\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-tropics-1920x1080-0ecbe1390717.jpg\" style=\"height:auto; width:auto\" /><br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nLike even warmer weather? In the south you can find the desert (some of it decorated in snow), but this desert isn‚Äôt barren on interesting places. Go off-road racing at <strong>Chonker‚Äôs Speedway</strong>, revel in cozy living at <strong>Condo Canyon</strong>, and something that will wet even the driest eyes, ‚Äúcome on down‚Äù to the returning <strong>Butter Barn</strong>.&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\n<img alt=\"Fortnite Desert\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-desert-1920x1080-6944785a092d.jpg\" style=\"height:auto; width:auto\" /><br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nThe bolded locations above are just a few of the Island‚Äôs many locales. Also, as the snow melts and reveals the grassland underneath, a previously snowed-in secret will be revealed!<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<hr />\n<h2><br />\nThe Weapons</h2>\n\n<p>A fresh slate of weapons awaits you on the Island. Here‚Äôs a rundown of what‚Äôs new!</p>\n\n<h3><br />\nRanger Assault Rifle</h3>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Fortnite Ranger Assault Rifle\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-ranger-assault-rifle-1900x600-8278cc086d1c.jpg\" style=\"height:auto; width:auto\" /><br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nMade for distance! The Ranger Assault Rifle is forceful at medium range and quite capable at long range.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3><br />\n<br />\nMK-Seven Assault Rifle</h3>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Fortnite MK-Seven Assault Rifle\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-mk-seven-assault-rifle-1900x600-02b2eb79744a.jpg\" /><br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nBuilt from The Seven‚Äôs technology, the MK-Seven Assault Rifle is a medium- to long-range weapon with a high rate of fire. This Assault Rifle has a sight you can use while aiming. Align your target with the sight‚Äôs red dot!<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nIf you want something even better, confront The Foundation for a special version of the MK-Seven Assault Rifle, sporting a slightly faster fire rate.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3><br />\n<br />\nStriker Pump Shotgun</h3>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Fortnite Striker Pump Shotgun\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-striker-pump-shotgun-1900x600-c16d0f61adbf.jpg\" style=\"height:auto; width:auto\" /><br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nThe Striker Pump Shotgun shoots a whole lot of pellets and boasts high burst damage. Aim‚Ä¶ then strike!</p>\n\n<h3><br />\n<br />\nAuto Shotgun</h3>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Fortnite Auto Shotgun\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-auto-shotgun-1900x600-7f45200d46fa.jpg\" style=\"height:auto; width:auto\" /><br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nAn automatic ally that lays down some serious firepower. The Auto Shotgun may not deal as much damage as the Striker Pump per shot, but it has a faster fire rate and reloads two shells at a time.</p>\n\n<h3><br />\n<br />\nSidearm Pistol</h3>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Fortnite Sidearm Pistol\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-sidearm-pistol-1900x600-b79f232ef257.jpg\" style=\"height:auto; width:auto\" /><br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nA trusty weapon to have by your side, the Sidearm Pistol is an accurate weapon that deals high damage at medium range and high headshot damage at close range. Don‚Äôt underestimate it!</p>\n\n<h3><br />\n<br />\nStinger SMG</h3>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Fortnite Stinger SMG\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-stinger-smg-1900x600-3bb2d84e53ec.jpg\" /><br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nAppropriately named, the Stinger SMG deals high damage to both opponents and structures. It stings at medium range more than one may expect!</p>\n\n<h3><br />\n<br />\nHunter Bolt-Action Sniper</h3>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Fortnite Hunter Bolt-Action Sniper\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-hunter-bolt-action-sniper-1900x600-2ca74b973a41.jpg\" /><br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nThe Hunter Bolt-Action Sniper deals high damage and can shoot three shots per clip. Get a second chance if you don‚Äôt land your shot the first time! (And a third... just in case.)<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<hr />\n<h2><br />\nThe Pastimes&nbsp;</h2>\n\n<h3><br />\nCamping</h3>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Fortnite Tent\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-tent-1900x600-51760a3fd859.jpg\" style=\"height:auto; width:auto\" /><br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nWith its many scenic routes and landmarks, the Island‚Äôs a prime place for camping out. After finding a <strong>Tent</strong> item, throw it down to assemble it, then rest in it to heal up. You can also safely stash up to three items in your Tent to collect in future matches. Two item slots are available automatically, and a third slot can be rented with Bars. For collecting your items in future matches, you‚Äôll just need to find a new Tent (or one of the many deserted ones!).<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nCamping‚Äôs even more fun with friends. If you‚Äôre playing in a Duos, Trios, or Squads team, start a group campsite to take in the views together. After a teammate throws down a Tent, other teammates can interact with it to purchase their own Tent with Bars. The Storm rolling up on your camp? Pack your Tents and take them to a new place to set up camp ‚Äî or leave ‚Äòem if there‚Äôs no time. You can access your items in other Tents you take ownership of!<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\n(As you‚Äôd expect, a stashed item will not be accessible if that item has been vaulted or is unavailable in the mode you‚Äôre in.)</p>\n\n<h3><br />\n<br />\nTaking the Crown (or Seizing It)</h3>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Fortnite Victory Crown\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-victory-crown-1900x600-34c3a08ed279.jpg\" style=\"height:auto; width:auto\" /><br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nPlace highly enough in a match and you‚Äôll be bestowed a Victory Crown. You‚Äôll start your next match wearing a crown ‚Äî but with bragging rights come high stakes...&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nThe crown will shine in all its glory, making you stand out to those seeking a Victory Crown of their own. Hold on to your crown for bonus XP during the match, and if you‚Äôre skilled enough to win while wearing the crown, you‚Äôll get an exclusive Emote ‚Äî showing off the total number of <strong>Crowned Victory Royales</strong> you‚Äôve earned during the Season!<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nVictory Crowns are present in the core Solo, Duos, Trios, and Squads modes. Here‚Äôs how the crowns are conferred:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><strong>Solo:</strong> Top four players</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><strong>Duos:</strong> Players in the top two teams</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><strong>Trios:</strong> Players in the top team</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><strong>Squads:</strong> Players in the top team</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>\n<style type=\"text/css\"><!--td {border: 1px solid #ccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;}-->\n</style>\n<br />\n<em>Update (December 9, 2021): Crowns are now only conferred to the top player in Solo and the top team in Duos, Trios, and Squads.</em></p>\n\n<h3><br />\n<br />\nMobility Maneuvers!</h3>\n\n<p>Running downhill? Try <strong>sliding</strong> to up your speed and evade enemy fire! While sliding, you still possess the abilities to shoot and build. Hold the crouch button while running to begin a slide, whether running downhill or not.<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"Fortnite Sliding\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-sliding-1920x1080-1265c56e803f.jpg\" style=\"height:auto; width:auto\" /><br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nGet fancy and swing after a slide. Starting December 11 at 10 AM ET, you‚Äôll be able to pick up <strong>Spider-Man‚Äôs Web-Shooters</strong>. Use them&nbsp;to swing on buildings ‚Äî The Daily Bugle included!&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"Fortnite Spider-Man's Web-Shooters\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-spider-mans-web-shooters-1900x600-7b28cfc9b56e.jpg\" /><br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nRetreat can be graceful too. When knocked into a Down But Not Out state, you can now crawl faster to help reach the safety of your squad. You can also pick up items, sort your inventory, and open Chests and doors. (Please note that Down But Not Out players on opposing teams can no longer be shaken down.)</p>\n\n<h3><br />\n<br />\nQuests</h3>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Fortnite XP\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-xp-1900x600-0e2d9554aa11.jpg\" /><br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nIn Chapter 3 Season 1, weekly Quests are no longer initiated on the Island itself. Instead, you can see what the Quests are in the ‚ÄúQuests‚Äù page in the Lobby ‚Äî so you already know what you‚Äôre gonna do before you board the Battle Bus. There are three main types of Quests, all of them viewable from the Quests page. You can access the Quests page during a match as well.<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nIn addition to the <strong>Daily</strong> Quests that refresh each day (9 AM ET) and can be shared among party members, there are the <strong>Season</strong> and <strong>Milestone</strong> Quests that stick around the whole Season. New Season Quests are added weekly (Thursdays at 9 AM ET), and Milestone Quests have multiple stages. Get bonus XP for completing certain numbers of Daily, Season, and Milestone Quests.&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nMake sure to visit the Sanctuary to experience a new type of Quest, featuring a communication device called simply ‚Äú<strong>The Device</strong>.‚Äù Through The Device you‚Äôll hear from <strong>The Scientist</strong>, The Seven's eccentric and sarcastic mastermind, and complete Quests that‚Äôll lead beyond the Season to unlock The Seven‚Äôs many secrets.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Speaking of Quests, A Note on XP</strong><br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nStarting with last Season‚Äôs v18.40 patch, players have been able to earn XP from Accolades in Creative (in maps/games/experiences that utilize the Accolade Device), as well as earn XP from Save the World.<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nPlayers earn XP towards their Battle Pass progress in Save the World when they:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Earn Mission Badges (obtained through normal Save the World gameplay, like exploring, building, and combat).</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Complete bonus mission objectives.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3><br />\n<br />\nComradery</h3>\n\n<p><strong>Working Together</strong><br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"Fortnite Squad Lock\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-squad-lock-1900x600-a13056310032.jpg\" style=\"height:auto; width:auto\" /><br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nSome actions on the new Island are quicker when more players chip in, like reviving a knocked teammate or starting up a Reboot Van. You'll also find special vaulted doors in your adventures that need more than one player to open. Work together with your team, form a temporary alliance with an opponent, or get creative‚Ä¶<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Med-Mist</strong><br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"Fortnite Med-Mist\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-med-mist-1900x600-234aaaef2ca6.jpg\" /><br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nIt‚Äôs true you can use the new <strong>Med-Mist</strong> to heal yourself, but you can also use it to heal your teammates. Whether you‚Äôre healing yourself or your allies, the Med-Mist restores Health for as long as you spray it. And you can spray it while moving&nbsp;on foot! Be aware there‚Äôs finite substance in the spray can, so spray smart.<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\n<strong>Guzzle Juice</strong><br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"Fortnite Guzzle Juice\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-guzzle-juice-1900x600-276238715f0f.jpg\" style=\"height:auto; width:auto\" /><br />\n<br />\nSpeaking of healing, <strong>Guzzle Juice</strong> has also made its debut. It can‚Äôt be shared like Med-Mist, but guzzle it down to restore your Health back to 100 over time. You may want to keep a low profile after drinking Guzzle Juice, as its healing will cease when you take damage from an opponent.<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<hr />\n<h2><br />\nThe People</h2>\n\n<h3><br />\nThe Former Loopers</h3>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Fortnite Metal Team Leader, Guaco, Mancake, Bunker Jonesy, and Lil' Whip\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-metal-team-leader-guaco-mancake-bunker-jonesy-and-lil-whip-1900x600-401c422428ce.jpg\" /><br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nThough the Island is new to you, it‚Äôs been long occupied by The Seven and those they freed from the Loop. Talk to Characters among the Island ‚Äî like Guaco at Greasy Grove, Bunker Jonesy at <strong>The Joneses</strong>, and Lil' Whip at <strong>Coney Crossroads</strong> ‚Äî to exchange Bars for goods and services.</p>\n\n<h3><br />\n<br />\nSpider-Man and More in the Battle Pass Line-Up</h3>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Fortnite Chapter 3 Season 1 Battle Pass\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-chapter-3-season-1-battle-pass-1900x600-2bd9f56f38e5.jpg\" style=\"height:auto; width:auto\" /><br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nYou can put on Spider-Man‚Äôs Web-Shooters no matter who you‚Äôre playing as, but you can also put them on as Spider-Man himself. With the Chapter 3 Season 1 Battle Pass, unlock characters like <strong>Spider-Man</strong> and, preceding him:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>The ‚ÄúLotus Walker‚Äù <strong>Shanta</strong>, unlocked immediately with the Battle Pass.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>The wanderer <strong>Ronin</strong>.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>The no-nonsense <strong>Lt. John Llama</strong>.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>The flavor-synthetic but attitude-authentic <strong>Gumbo</strong>.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>The optimistic outlaw <strong>Harlowe</strong>.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>The Island-raised and Island-defending <strong>Haven</strong>.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<br />\nLater on in the Season, unlock the leader of The Seven <strong>The Foundation</strong>.<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nAnd speaking of Spider-Man, look out for new Spideys (plus a few friends and foes) dropping into the Item Shop throughout the Season!<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"font-size:12px\">¬© 2021 Marvel</span></p>\n\n<h3><br />\n<br />\nYou, Your Friends, and New Ones</h3>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Fortnite Player Profiles\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-player-profiles-1900x600-da89a7f49899.png\" style=\"height:auto; width:auto\" /><br />\n<br />\nSome players may notice more robust player profiles! In the new <strong>Sidebar</strong> ‚Äî currently in testing ‚Äî click on a friend‚Äôs profile to see the playlist they‚Äôre currently in, their server region, selected language, Passes (whether they‚Äôre a Fortnite Crew member and whether they own the Battle Pass), and your mutual friends. The Sidebar will be incrementally rolled out to all Battle Royale/Creative players at a rate depending on the test. (<a href=\"#Sidebar Privacy Settings\" target=\"_self\">Jump to info on privacy settings.</a>)<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nLooking to add new friends? In the Sidebar, like the ‚ÄúSocial‚Äù menu before it, you can see a list of suggested friends (friends of your friends), players you recently played with, or players from your search input. Also like the previous ‚ÄúSocial‚Äù menu, the Sidebar is accessible from the top-left of the screen. The main menu (where ‚ÄúSettings‚Äù and more options can be found) is now selectable from the Sidebar.<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nWhen viewing the profile of someone who isn‚Äôt a friend yet, you can see if they‚Äôre in your party or team, their server region, and their selected language. If they‚Äôre a ‚Äúsuggested friend,‚Äù a result of your search input, or someone who sent you a friend request, you‚Äôll see your mutual friends (if any). If they‚Äôre a player with whom you ‚Äúrecently played,‚Äù you‚Äôll see your last interaction. For example: ‚ÄúPlayed Trios together 6 days ago.‚Äù<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\n<a id=\"Sidebar Privacy Settings\" name=\"Sidebar Privacy Settings\"></a>You can adjust who can see your profile information. Edit your profile to individually select ‚ÄúPrivate,‚Äù ‚ÄúFriends Only,‚Äù or ‚ÄúPublic‚Äù visibility for your server region, selected language, and mutual friends. Passes can only be toggled to ‚ÄúPrivate‚Äù or ‚ÄúFriends Only‚Äù visibility.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n<style type=\"text/css\"><!--td {border: 1px solid #ccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;}-->\n</style>\n<em>Update (December 10, 2021): As of December 7, the new Sidebar is no longer in testing.

Later on in Chapter 3 Season 1, see the effects of <strong>lightning</strong> and spin around in and get shot out of <strong>tornadoes</strong>.<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<hr />\n<h2><br />\nThe Wildlife</h2>\n\n<p>Speaking of things to come, researchers believe there‚Äôs a new addition to wildlife on this Island. Researchers theorize this species is quite large, which is why they‚Äôre surprised they haven‚Äôt seen it yet.&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nUnlike the previous Island, Raptors have not been seen roaming the new one. Perhaps they‚Äôre scared of the supposed beast?&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<hr />\n<h2><br />\nSome Road (or Off-Road) Rules üööüöó</h2>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Shopping Carts and All Terrain Karts (ATKs) have returned to the vault, but Quadcrashers are now out of the vault!</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Vehicles now take considerably more damage from explosives than before.

These are experiences that are designed as places for players to hang out, play fun mini-games, and make new friends. Here are two example Party Worlds that got made in collaboration with Epic:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Walnut World by fivewalnut</strong> (Island code: 9705-9549-4193)</p>\n\n<p>Adventure around Walnut World, an amusement park where you can hang out with your friends or make new ones!<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Fortnite Creative Walnut World By Fivewalnut\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-creative-walnut-world-by-fivewalnut-1920x1080-f43bf22cda3c.png\" style=\"height:auto; width:auto\" /></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<strong>Late Night Lounge by TreyJTH</strong> (Island code: 8868-0043-1912)</p>\n\n<p>Visit the late night lounge for a friendly and frivolous after hours adventure.

Party Worlds are places that are designed to be fun locations to hangout with friends and potentially make new ones. It‚Äôs a space where you can go, relax, have a good time and play some mini-games. Unlike Hubs, Party Worlds will not link to other islands, so they won‚Äôt serve as a discovery tool.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2><br />\nCreate your own Social Space</h2>\n\n<p>This is just the beginning! What are the places you‚Äôd like to hangout with your friends? We want you to create your own Party Worlds and show us the most amazing Party locations you can think of.

The matchmaking portal will allow players to enter the latest approved version of that island code.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>This prevents islands that have been reviewed to link to unreviewed islands. If the version number is not entered and the island code has not yet been reviewed an error message will be displayed.</p>\n\n<h2>New: Accolade Device&nbsp;</h2>\n\n<p>The Accolade device allows creators to design achievements or accomplishments that players can complete to earn Battle Pass XP while playing your map! Creators will have several customization options to best fit the design of your experience, including Accolade Name, Accolade Type, Target Value, and Triggers.</p>\n\n<p>For the Accolade device to be active in your experience, it will need to go through calibration. Calibration is a process of measuring data for a newly released or recently updated game, to ensure the Accolade device provides the correct amount of Battle Pass XP.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>When a game is newly released or updated, there is an Initial Calibration period where data is being gathered before the system decides that there is sufficient data to drive the mechanics of the Accolade Device.</li>\n\t<li>Initial Calibration comes in 2 phases:\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Data Gathering</li>\n\t\t<li>Data Analysis</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>During the Initial Calibration period, players can only earn Playtime XP in your map.\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>The system still keeps track of enabled Accolades being triggered.</li>\n\t\t<li>Playtime XP is defined by Epic and is not related to the Playtime Accolades made available to Creators.</li>\n\t\t<li>Playtime XP will be disabled after initial calibration is over</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Because the Calibration process needs to gather data, the length of the Initial Calibration period is dependent on the amount of engagement that a map gets during that period, so will vary from map to map.</p>\n\n<p>We‚Äôll notify Creators through email whenever there is a key event in the game‚Äôs calibration. These key events include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Start of Initial Calibration&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li>Initial Calibration Warning</li>\n\t<li>Initial Calibration Passed&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li>Initial Calibration Failed</li>\n\t<li>Post Calibration Failure</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>For further details on the <a href=\"https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/creative/docs/using-accolades-devices-in-fortnite-creative\">Accolade Device visit the Fortnite Creative Documentation website.</a> In addition to the Creative Documentation, we hosted a Q&amp;A in our <a href=\"https://discord.gg/QHpRDPVKdy\">Fortnite Creative Discord</a> that you can view answers to questions other creators had.</p>\n\n<h2>New: Item Remover Device</h2>\n\n<p>This device allows you to remove items directly from a player‚Äôs inventory without using Checkpoints or Capture Areas.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>You can choose the type and amount of items to remove and even add specific items to the device for precise control of what to remove.&nbsp; You can even force items to drop on the ground and affect all players in a team or class simultaneously.</p>\n\n<p>For more information on the <a href=\"https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/creative/docs/using-item-remover-devices-in-fortnite-creative\">Item Remover Device visit our Fortnite Creative Documentation Site&nbsp;</a></p>\n\n<h2>Update: Timer Device</h2>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">We‚Äôve now moved the persistence features of the Timer device out of beta and into full release so you can now pause, resume and continue timers between sessions for your players.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Update: Shooting Gallery Device</h2>\n\n<p>The shooting gallery gets a whole lot of love in this update.&nbsp;

For clarity, if you participate in the program as a referrer, you will not be able to later participate as a referee (and vice versa).<br />\n<br />\nBoth referrers and referees need to be friends in-game to participate in this program. Only referrers need to register on the program website, but referees can still register if they would like to check their own progression.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nPoints earned by playing with a referrer/referee will accumulate until specific thresholds are met, at which point, the referrer and/or referee will receive the designated reward for meeting that threshold. For example, by completing the final challenge, which requires referrers and referees to level up their Fortnite accounts by 60 career levels, participants can unlock the Rainbow Racer Outfit! Please note that while referrers can participate with up to 5 different referees, each participant (whether a referrer or a referee) can only earn a reward once.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nFor full program details and eligibility requirements, please read the <a href=\"https://referafriend.fortnite.com/faq/\" target=\"_blank\">Fortnite Refer a Friend Program Terms of Participation.</a></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"Fortnite Refer a Friend Beta\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/social-1928x1088-9a033d3fccd7.png\" /></p>\n","description":"The Fortnite Refer a Friend program starts on Oct 25.

If you need a place to start, here‚Äôs a great <a href=\"https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/introducing-players-to-your-new-fortnite-creative-island-and-map\">onboarding guide</a> that‚Äôll help get you started on your creative journey.</p>\n\n<h2>Welcome Hub Design Guide</h2>\n\n<p>The best Welcome Hubs should empower players to identify content that they want to engage with and provide them with a path to easily navigate the game or island experience. To effectively connect players with content, a successful hub designer will continually iterate on discovery and theme. There are two main types of hub design: the Spoke model and the Cardinal model, you‚Äôll see diagrams for both below and any specific call-outs.</p>\n\n<p>Before getting started with the design guide, let‚Äôs review the two hub layout legends to see the major differences and requirements of each.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h4>Spoke</h4>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Hub TopDown Spoke 01\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/hub-topdown-spoke-01-2818x1772-715a652a0aa8.jpg\" style=\"height:auto; width:auto\" /></p>\n\n<h4>Cardinal<img alt=\"Hub TopDown Cardinal 01\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/hub-topdown-cardinal-01-2818x1772-76cd78084ac4.jpg\" style=\"height:auto; width:auto\" /></h4>\n\n<h2>Basic Creative Hub Requirements</h2>\n\n<h3>Load a Featured Hub template to get started and make sure to follow the criteria outlined below...</h3>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">Hub must not exceed 40,000 Memory</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">All social media or creator code callout text must be moved to one specific area outside of the initial spawn point, <strong>not</strong> directly in front of the player when they spawn.</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">Your ‚ÄúVoice Chat‚Äù option must be changed from <strong>Team </strong>setting to <strong>All</strong>.</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">Do not include devices which damage or eliminate players.</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">Do not use excessive effects which may result in performance issues for the server.\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li aria-level=\"2\">Moderating the use of particle effects, transparent layers, and physics balls will help limit issues.</li>\n\t\t<li aria-level=\"2\">Avoid using groupings of lights in one spot</li>\n\t\t<li aria-level=\"2\">Do not use excessive amounts of glass\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li aria-level=\"3\"><strong>For example</strong>: Do not have glass overlaying more glass</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</li>\n\t\t<li aria-level=\"2\">Reduce the amount of unique objects as much as possible, especially if only used a few times or within portal area pathways\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li aria-level=\"3\"><strong>For example</strong>: Using 100 unique objects is worse than using 100 of the same objects (regarding memory usage and performance)</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">Do not include game mechanics which obstruct or distract players from the portal area pathways.</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">The center spawn arena must be flat, <strong>obstruction-free</strong>, and be a maximum of one tile high.</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">Make sure you have included 4 player spawn points for the Epic Games Creative team to review the quality level of the hub. Note: We may request changes based on our review process.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">If you choose to include hidden easter eggs or interactions within your Hub, you <strong>must </strong>submit an additional video showing all hidden content</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">You must have player flight turned on for QA testing. It will be removed by us if necessary.\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li aria-level=\"2\">Do not place blocking volumes in the sky until <strong>after </strong>you‚Äôve placed the above required 2-4 player spawns for reviews.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">Matchmaking portals must stay in designated areas and be placed by the creator.</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">Do not alter default player movement speed.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>If your Creative Island has met these requirements, let‚Äôs move to to how you can iterate on your hub‚Äôs discovery and theme!&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2>New Creative Hub Layout Philosophy</h2>\n\n<p>Now that we‚Äôve covered the specific required things you need for your hub to be considered for Epic featuring, let‚Äôs dig into how you can really make it pop and easy to navigate!</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Portal areas should be treated as the primary destination and not a secondary location.</li>\n\t<li>Hub layout should clearly convey how you want the player to interact and navigate.&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li>Utilize the 4 Portal area pathways.</li>\n\t<li>You can freely customize the areas located at the rear of the Hub.</li>\n\t<li>Signs/Iconography above the pathways should have no competing elements.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Design Guidelines</h2>\n\n<p>Moving on to aesthetics guidelines! all areas within the Hub should be cohesive with the theme of the world and contain a purposeful interaction with the player.</p>\n\n<h3>Choosing a Theme</h3>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">Pick a strong singular theme</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><img alt=\"SummerHub 05\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/summerhub-05-2550x1231-92186b0565e0.jpg\" style=\"height:auto; width:auto\" /></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Create visually interesting areas in the map with purpose for the player\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li><strong>For Example</strong>: The best hubs have visually interesting areas that are laid out with the purpose of directing players to feature content.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>Ensure you properly research the theme you are attempting to replicate within your hub when executing on the overall visuals within the map</li>\n\t<li>Play around with&nbsp; adjusting settings, including:\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Time of Day</li>\n\t\t<li>Camera Filter</li>\n\t\t<li>Light Brightness</li>\n\t\t<li>Light Color</li>\n\t\t<li>Fog Thickness</li>\n\t\t<li>Fog Color</li>\n\t\t<li>Gravity</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Navigation Tips</h3>\n\n<p>Your players should know where to go.</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">Beginning at the player spawn, include straight and clearly defined pathways that allow players to easily navigate to portal areas.\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li aria-level=\"2\">Portals must remain in the designated areas.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">Do not create distractions which direct players away from the main portal areas.</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">Utilize design around the portal areas.</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">The spawn area must be clear so players don‚Äôt spawn into objects.</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">Paths to each portal area should be clear, unobstructed, and not include any distractions.&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">Clear separation of navigation signage within the Hub</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><img alt=\"PortalPathGatewayObscured Bad\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/portalpathgatewayobscured-bad-2560x1440-a2807a9e819c.jpg\" style=\"height:auto;

width:auto\" /></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">Sign and icons within the portal areas should match the environment.&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">Remove any line of sight (LOS) blockers to each area.</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">Do not create pathways that players are unable to tell apart from the surrounding environment\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li aria-level=\"2\"><strong>For Example</strong>: Grass pathways in a lush green environment&nbsp;</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">Adjust your matchmaking portals to fit the design needs of that area, but they must remain the designated location.\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li aria-level=\"2\"><strong>For Example</strong>: If you make a circular room for your portal area, you can adjust the portals to fit the curvature of the space you have chosen.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><img alt=\"MatchmakingPortals Bad 02\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/matchmakingportals-bad-02-2560x1360-fad7d13838d6.jpg\" style=\"height:auto;

In general, stay away from flashing lights.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>We can‚Äôt wait to see what you create! If you‚Äôre looking for inspiration, follow us on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/FortniteGame\">Twitter</a> where we post info and images of new featured islands.</p>\n\n<h2><a id=\"FAQ\" name=\"FAQ\"><strong>FAQ:</strong></a></h2>\nWe made a handy calendar that is available in <a href=\"https://discord.gg/fC6EzRc5cw¬†\" target=\"_blank\">Fortnite Creative Discord</a>&nbsp;where you all can track when we‚Äôre going to be requesting hub submissions for each season in the year.&nbsp;\n\n<p><strong>Q: </strong>How do I submit a Hub for approval?&nbsp;<br />\nA: Be sure to read our <a href=\"https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/fortnite-creative-featured-islands-and-hub-guidelines\">Fortnite Featured Hub design guidelines</a> before sending in your submission. Submit your game in the <a href=\"https://epicsupport.force.com/creative\">Fortnite Creative Featured Content form</a> by the submission deadline and use the dropdown ‚ÄúHub‚Äùoption.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Q:</strong> How long do I have to submit?<br />\nA: Once the announcement is made to the community, creators will have 6 weeks to submit Seasonal hubs and 4 weeks for Holiday hubs. After the submission window has passed we will close submissions for the event.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Q:</strong> What if my Hub is not a holiday or seasonal hub, can I still submit?<br />\nA: Creators will still be able to submit their hubs at any point no matter the callout, however even if we don't feature your hub during the period when you submit it, we may use it in the future when it aligns with the holiday/season. Note: If you have a hub that fits into one of the callouts It is better to wait for the call out that lines up thematically with your hub.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Q</strong>: How do you know if your hub was picked?<br />\nA: A few weeks after the call out ends, Epic staff will start reaching out to creators to make changes to their hubs. Once all changes are made and the team has tested your hub and received approval to move forward you will be given your feature date.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Q:</strong> What if we don‚Äôt live in the US and our holidays look different?&nbsp;<br />\nA: Great question, we understand our creative community reaches long and far which is why the submissions are not limited to one region. For example: if you live in Brazil and you celebrate winter holiday on the beach, please create a Hub to represent your experience and submit it. If it gets featured everyone will get a chance to experience a winter holiday in Brazil.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Q:</strong> Can I submit a hub anytime?<br />\nA: Yes we will still be featuring all regular hubs.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Q:</strong> What if I submit a hub for either seasonal or holiday but it is past the end date?<br />\nA:&nbsp; If you submit a hub past the call out timeframe it will be rejected. To limit confusion we ask that creators put in (type of call out) in the title.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n","description":"Please read the Fortnite Creative Featured Islands and Hub Guidelines.

I mean, The Sideways is kind of cool, but other than that, I‚Äôm fully on his side.<br />\n<br />\nWell actually not fully. Digging into the IO takes up pretty much all my time, but I‚Äôm at least doing a favor by writing this in his place. Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs new that can help you on the Island:</p>\n\n<h2><br />\nNew Chug Splash Flavor: Chili Chug Splash</h2>\n\n<p>Staying on top of the IO 24/7 takes A LOT of energy‚Ä¶ which is why the new Chug Splash flavor couldn‚Äôt have come at a better time.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nThe Chug Splash people just dropped <strong>Chili Chug Splash</strong>, Chug Splash with a kick. It restores Health and Shield like you‚Äôd expect, but it also gives you such an energy boost it‚Äôll give you a speed boost too. Think of eating a Spicy Fish or a Pepper. (Or don‚Äôt think of it. The Chili Chug Splash tastes just like them...) And hey, since it‚Äôs a Chug Splash, you can share the kick with others too. Get your squads‚Äô feet and noses running.<br />\n<br />\nChili Chug Splashes are Exotic. Exchange Bars with The Brat for some or find some in Loot Llamas.<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"Fortnite Chili Chug Splash\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-chili-chug-splash-1920x1080-c0529a10d270.jpg\" style=\"height:auto; width:auto\" /></p>\n\n<h2><br />\nSplash the OG Chug Splash and Wear the Hunter‚Äôs Cloak</h2>\n\n<p>Alongside the debut of Chili Chug Splash, the original Chug Splash has been re-released. It may not have that kick, but the Health and Shield nutritional value is all the same. (It‚Äôs also much easier on the taste buds.) Being the Chug Splash the Island knows and loves, you can pick some up as normal loot.<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"Fortnite Chug Splash\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-chug-splash-1920x1080-9637b149ea7b.jpg\" style=\"height:auto; width:auto\" /><br />\n<br />\nIt‚Äôs really difficult to sneak around when a wolf is thinking I‚Äôm their food. That shouldn‚Äôt be an issue anymore, though, because ‚Äî speaking of things returning ‚Äî the Island has collectively remembered how to make a Hunter‚Äôs Cloak. <strong>Craft a Hunter‚Äôs Cloak by combining Meat.</strong> (It‚Äôs honestly kind of gross, but it does take less Meat than it did before.)</p>\n\n<h2><br />\nIf You‚Äôre Stopping by Steamy Stacks...</h2>\n\n<p>Something weird I noticed: there‚Äôs a big hole at Steamy Stacks. Was there an accident on the job? Did something‚Ä¶ escape from the ground?&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nCould be something for you to investigate.<br />\n<br />\n- Charlotte<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p><br />\n<em>What else is new in Fortnite Battle Royale in v18.10:</em></p>\n\n<h2><br />\nSuper Level Styles and XP Improvements</h2>\n\n<p>The Cubes have corrupted even the Battle Pass! (But in a good way.) Bonus Styles for Chapter 2 Season 8 Outfits have been available for players who progress past Level 100. But now: this Season‚Äôs Super Level Styles have been added! Progress past Level 140 this Season and start unlocking new runic Styles for Charlotte, Kor, Fabio Sparklemane, J.B.

(They still reward Bars too.)</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>All new and future Character Punchcards have substantially increased XP rewards.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Weekly Punchcard XP has been slightly reduced.

No other player with a score lower than the Winning Players shall be, at any time or under any circumstances, entitled to win any prizes in connection with the Event.<br />\n<br />\nFor clarity, prizes are awarded ‚Äúas is‚Äù with no warranty or guarantee, either express or implied. &nbsp;Prizes are not transferable or assignable and cannot be transferred by Winning Players. &nbsp;Non-cash prizes (if any) cannot be redeemed for cash. &nbsp;All prize details are at the sole discretion of Epic. &nbsp;Winning Players are not entitled to any surplus between actual retail value of prize and approximate retail value and any difference between approximate and actual value of the prize will not be awarded. &nbsp;Winning Players are responsible for any costs and expenses associated with prize acceptance and use not specified herein as being provided. &nbsp;Winning Players may not substitute a prize, but Epic reserves the right, at its sole discretion, in case of justified reasons, to substitute a prize (or portion thereof) with one of comparable or greater value. &nbsp;Additional terms and conditions may apply to acceptance and use of a prize.<br />\n<br />\nThe highest scoring players will be notified by Epic of their status as a potential Winning Player at the email address associated with such players‚Äô Epic account within 30 days of completion of the Event, or such other time as reasonably required by Epic for such notification, and will be subject to verification of eligibility pursuant to Section 3 and compliance with these Rules. &nbsp;A potential Winning Player must keep the Epic account that he or she used to compete in the Event active throughout the verification of eligibility process.<br />\n<br />\nUpon formal notification from Epic, a potential Winning Player shall have 45 days from the date such notice was emailed to respond and provide any information or materials requested by Epic, including the Release (as defined below) for purposes of verification of eligibility pursuant to Section 3. &nbsp;Such response from a potential Winning Player must be delivered to the email address from which Epic‚Äôs notification was sent or, at Epic‚Äôs sole option, another email address specified in the notification. &nbsp;The date of receipt by Epic shall be decisive for a potential Winning Player‚Äôs compliance with the deadlines set forth in this Section 2.7.2.<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nIn the event of (a) the failure by any such player to (i) keep the Epic account that he or she used to compete in the Event active throughout the verification of eligibility process or (ii) timely respond to any notification or request for materials or information; or (b) any such player being unable to accept or receive the prize for any reason (including, without limitation, for failure to provide the necessary tax and payment information through Epic‚Äôs approved tax and payment processing vendors), then in either case (items (a) or (b)), such player shall be disqualified as a potential Winning Player, and such player shall not be entitled to win any prizes in connection with the Event. &nbsp;In such cases, no alternate Winning Player will be named, and Epic shall have the right, in its sole and absolute discretion, to (y) award any prize amounts that would have otherwise been awarded to such disqualified player as part of a future Game competitive event or (z) award any such prize amounts to non-profit causes and efforts. &nbsp;A Winning Player will only be announced once the verification of eligibility process has been completed by Epic pursuant to these Rules.<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nWinning Players will also be required to provide certain payment information to Epic, including any required tax information forms, in order to receive the prizes. Epic may withhold payment of the prizes if the Winning Player fails to provide the applicable payment forms to Epic in a timely manner. &nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nPRIZES ARE SUBJECT TO APPLICABLE INTERNATIONAL, FEDERAL, STATE, AND LOCAL TAXES (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, INCOME AND WITHHOLDING TAXES) &nbsp;AND IT IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF EACH WINNING PLAYER TO (I) CHECK WITH HIS OR HER LOCAL TAX ADVISOR TO DETERMINE WHICH TAXES APPLY TO HIM OR HER AND (II) PAY SUCH TAXES TO THE APPROPRIATE TAX AUTHORITY. &nbsp;It is Epic's policy to withhold tax at the backup withholding rates in effect for US and non-US residents. &nbsp;Prize income and tax withholding will be reported on forms (y) 1099-MISC for US residents and 1042-S for non-US residents, and (z) any other relevant tax forms as may be required by applicable law. &nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nEpic will determine the payment method for the prizes in its sole discretion and, except as otherwise required by applicable law, all payments will be made directly to the Winning Player in his or her capacity as an individual (or, if a Minor, to the Winning Player‚Äôs parent or legal guardian). &nbsp;For the avoidance of doubt, no prize payments will be made by Epic to any organization, company, or other entity. &nbsp;Each Winning Player will be provided a Prize Acceptance and Release Form (‚ÄúRelease‚Äù). &nbsp;Unless restricted by applicable law, each Winning Player (or, if a Minor, such Winning Player‚Äôs parent or legal guardian) will be required to complete and submit the Release in accordance with the deadlines set forth in this Section 2.7.2.<br />\n<br />\n3.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Player Eligibility<br />\n<br />\n3.1&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Player Age<br />\n<br />\n3.1.1&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;To be eligible to participate in any Event match, a player must be at least 13 years old (or such other age, if greater, as may be required in such player‚Äôs country of residence). &nbsp;If a player is under 18 years of age or the age of majority as defined in such player‚Äôs country of residence (a ‚ÄúMinor‚Äù), such player must have permission from a parent or legal guardian in order to participate in the Event.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n3.1.2&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Ineligible players who mislead or attempt to mislead Event Administrators by providing false eligibility information will be subject to disciplinary actions as further described in Section 9.2.<br />\n<br />\n3.2&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Fortnite EULA<br />\n<br />\nEach player must follow the Fortnite End User License Agreement (‚ÄúFortnite EULA‚Äù) (https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/eula).

This means that, without limitation, a player‚Äôs Epic account must be registered in such player‚Äôs name, and cannot have been previously purchased, gifted, or otherwise transferred from another player.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n3.6.2.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Players must be free of or served fully any suspensions or other sanctions imposed in connection with a previous violation of any official Epic rules. Additionally, (a) players who received a competitive ban of 14 days or longer during Chapter 2 Season 8 will be ineligible to participate in the Event; and (b) players who receive a competitive ban of 14 days or longer during the Event will be ineligible to (i) participate further in the Event, and/or (ii) participate in the immediately subsequent FNCS season.<br />\n<br />\n3.6.3&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;A player‚Äôs Epic account must be level one-hundred (100) or above.

Players are expressly prohibited from having additional Event entries using additional or secondary Epic account(s), and/or participating from more than one (1) Region.<br />\n<br />\n4.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Player/Team Formation Rules<br />\n<br />\n4.1&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Duos<br />\n<br />\n4.1.1 &nbsp; &nbsp;Each Duos player (or, if a Minor, such player‚Äôs parent or legal guardian) must acknowledge and accept these Rules in-game pursuant to Section 1.2 before participating in the Event.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n4.1.2 &nbsp; &nbsp;During the Event, all players on a team must be present and partied up together in order to participate. Players on a team may not play Solo. If a team does not have all members present and partied up together by the start time for a given match, it will be considered to have finished in (or tied for) last place with zero eliminations for that match.<br />\n<br />\n4.1.3 &nbsp; &nbsp;Players may only participate on one team at a time throughout each session. If a team qualifies for Stage 2 and/or Stage 3 of the Champion Series, both players will be jointly locked to that team for that stage, and will be prohibited from participating in any additional Stage 1 or Stage 2 matches (as applicable). If an individual player qualifies to Stage 2 multiple times with different teams through the Series Points advancement as listed in Section 2.6.9, the team with the higher Series Points value will be the qualified team and the team with the lower Series Points value will not be valid.&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\n4.1.4 &nbsp; &nbsp;All members of a team that fall within the prizing thresholds set forth in Section 2.7.1 must successfully pass the verification of eligibility process described in Section 2.7.2 in order to be eligible to receive such prizes. If one member of a team fails the verification of eligibility process, all members of that team will be disqualified as potential Winning Players, and that team shall not be entitled to win any prizes in connection with the Event.<br />\n<br />\n4.1.5 &nbsp; &nbsp;Each member of a team shall be deemed to have jointly and severally made and entered into all of the representations, warranties, and agreements contained herein and shall be jointly and severally obligated and bound thereby. Except as otherwise expressly set forth herein, all of the Event Administrators‚Äô rights pursuant to these Rules relate to and are exercisable against the team as a whole and each individual member of the team. If any right of disqualification arises as to any individual member of the team, then the right of disqualification may be exercised against the team as a whole, as the Event Administrators may elect in their sole discretion.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n4.1.6 &nbsp; &nbsp;Earned Series Points, Qualifier, Semi-Finals, or Finals qualification spots (as applicable) cannot be transferred, sold, traded, or gifted to any person or organization. This means that, without limitation, earned Series Points will always be connected directly to the entire team as a whole.<br />\n<br />\n5.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Issues<br />\n<br />\n5.1&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Definition of Terms<br />\n<br />\n5.1.1&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Bug&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nAn error, flaw, failure, or fault that produces an incorrect or unexpected result, or otherwise causes the Game and/or a hardware device to behave in unintended ways.<br />\n<br />\n5.1.2&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Intentional Disconnection&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nA player losing connection to the Game due to the player‚Äôs actions. Any actions of a player which lead to a disconnection shall be deemed intentional, regardless of the actual intent of the player. Intentional disconnection is not considered a valid technical issue for the purposes of a remake.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n5.1.3&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Server Crash&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nAll players losing connection to the Game due to an issue with the Game server.<br />\n<br />\n5.1.4&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Unintentional Disconnection&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nA player losing connection to the Game due to problems or issues with the game client, platform, network, or PC.<br />\n<br />\n5.2&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Technical Issues<br />\n<br />\n5.2.1&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Due to the nature and scale of online competition, except as otherwise determined by Epic in its sole discretion, matches will not be restarted or made null due to Bugs, Intentional Disconnections, Server Crashes, or Unintentional Disconnections. Except as otherwise determined by Epic in its sole discretion, any technical issues or Bug encounters, whether defined in this Section 5 or not, must be played through and will not be cause for a remake.<br />\n<br />\n5.2.2&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Without limitation of the foregoing, players are prohibited from taking advantage of or otherwise exploiting any Bug that allows a player to participate in any Event round or stage without having first qualified for such round or stage pursuant to the terms of these Rules.<br />\n<br />\n5.2.3&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; In addition, players acknowledge and agree that in participating in a Game competitive event the individual player solely determines which platform to use (i.e., PC, console, or mobile (as applicable)) and understands that he/she may face players competing on a different platform. Additionally, players acknowledge that the different platforms may offer features, such as controllers, player interface, and/or ability to individualize certain game settings/sensitivities, etc., which may arguably provide a competitive advantage to one platform over another. Players acknowledge their sole competitive platform choice and agree and waive any responsibility or liability of Epic relating to such player‚Äôs involvement in a multiplatform competition, including any alleged competitive advantage of any other platform.<br />\n<br />\n6.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Communication<br />\n<br />\n6.1&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Event Administrators will be available to answer player-specific questions and provide additional assistance throughout the Event via the official player support channel found here: https://epicgames.helpshift.com/a/fortnite/?contact=1&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n7.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Post-Match Process<br />\n<br />\n7.1&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Scoring<br />\n<br />\n7.1.1&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The Game client will record and report a player‚Äôs score at the conclusion of such player‚Äôs participation in a match.<br />\n<br />\n7.1.2&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;At times, unforeseen issues may arise that result in score reporting delays and/or inaccuracies. For the duration of the Event, the score displayed within the Leaderboard will be the official score, regardless of accuracy.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n7.1.3&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Without limitation of the foregoing, after a Round or Stage has ended, it may be necessary to adjust the Leaderboard standings (typically due to players or teams being DQ‚Äôd and removed from the Leaderboard for breaking these Rules). For advancement purposes, at the end of the applicable Round or Stage, the Leaderboard standings will be snapshotted, and those advancements will be immediately awarded and considered ‚Äúfinal‚Äù for purposes of player or team advancement only, subject in all cases to final adjustment and confirmation by Epic.<br />\n<br />\n8.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Code of Conduct<br />\n<br />\n8.1&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Personal Conduct; No Toxic Behavior<br />\n<br />\n8.1.1&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;All players must conduct themselves in a way that is at all times consistent with (a) the Code of Conduct in this Section 8 (‚ÄúCode of Conduct‚Äù) and (b) the general principles of personal integrity, honesty, and good sportsmanship.<br />\n<br />\n8.1.2&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Players must be respectful of other players, Event Administrators, spectators, and sponsors (as applicable).<br />\n<br />\n8.1.3&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Players shall not behave in a manner (a) which violates these Rules, (b) which is disruptive, unsafe or destructive, or (c) which is otherwise harmful to the enjoyment of the Game by other users as intended by Epic (as decided by Epic). In particular, players shall not engage in harassing or disrespectful conduct, use of abusive or offensive language, game sabotage, spamming, social engineering, scamming, or any unlawful activity (‚ÄúToxic Behavior‚Äù).<br />\n<br />\n8.1.4&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Players shall not (a) proclaim to be, or represent themselves as, a banned player or a cheater/rule breaker, or (b) glorify or otherwise endorse the breaking or violation of these Rules.<br />\n<br />\n8.1.5&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Any violation of these Rules may expose a player to disciplinary action as further described in Section 9.2, whether or not that violation was committed intentionally.<br />\n<br />\n8.2&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Competitive Integrity<br />\n<br />\n8.2.1&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Each player is expected to play within the spirit of the Game and these Rules at all times during any Event match. &nbsp;Any form of unfair play is prohibited by these Rules, and may result in disciplinary action. &nbsp;Examples of unfair play include the following:<br />\n<br />\nCollusion (as defined below), match fixing or throwing, bribing a referee or match official, or any other unfair or illegal action or agreement to intentionally influence (or attempt to influence) the outcome of any match or Event.<br />\n<br />\nHacking or otherwise modifying the intended behavior of the Game client.<br />\n<br />\nPlaying or allowing another player to play on an Epic account registered in another person‚Äôs name (or soliciting, encouraging, or directing someone else to do so).<br />\n<br />\nUsing any kind of cheating device, program, or similar cheating method to gain a competitive advantage.<br />\n<br />\nIntentionally exploiting any game function (e.g., an in-game bug or glitch) in a manner not intended by Epic in order to gain a competitive advantage.<br />\n<br />\nUsing distributed denial of service attacks, swatting, or similar methods to interfere with another player‚Äôs connection to the Game‚Äôs game client.<br />\n<br />\nUsing macro keys or similar methods to automate in-game actions.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nAccepting any gift, reward, bribe, or compensation for services promised, rendered, or to be rendered in connection with unfair play of the Game (e.g., services designed to throw or fix a match or session).<br />\n<br />\nUtilizing outside assistance regarding the location of other players, other players‚Äô health or equipment, or any other information not otherwise known to the player by the information on his or her own screen (e.g., looking at or attempting to look at spectator monitors while currently in a match). For clarity, a player‚Äôs receipt of coaching or use of the in-game replay tool does not fall within this prohibition.<br />\n<br />\nIntentionally disconnecting from the Game after you or a member of your team takes damage. For clarity, this only applies to players who intentionally disconnect with a member of their team receiving damage within 60 seconds prior to the intentional disconnection.<br />\n<br />\n8.2.2&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Players may not work together to deceive or otherwise cheat other players during any match (‚ÄúCollusion‚Äù).

Let‚Äôs break down the dates:</p>\n\n<h3>Qualifiers (February 17-18 &amp; February 19-20)</h3>\n\n<p>We‚Äôre keeping the same number of Qualifiers as last season, but in the new Duos format, we have increased the number of teams that directly qualify for Finals. The top eight teams from each Qualifier will advance directly to the FNCS Finals.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3>Semi-Finals (February 24-27)</h3>\n\n<p>Semi-Finals will also work slightly differently this FNCS season. Achieving a Victory Royale in any single-lobby tournament match is a pinnacle Fortnite achievement. We‚Äôre excited to deliver more Victory Royale focused action this season along with rewarding consistent performance. For any Session, you‚Äôll either need to win a game, or be one of the top six most consistent teams during that Session to advance to the Finals.<br />\n<br />\nOnly the top 50 teams from the Series Point Leaderboard will compete during Session 1 in each region. Session 1 will consist of five matches, and 11 teams from this Session will advance to the Finals (5 Victory Royale winners and top 6 consistent teams).<br />\n<br />\nSession 2 will fill the 11 vacant team spots with the 51st-61st teams on the Series Point Leaderboard. This new 50-team lobby will also run five matches and advance 11 teams to the Finals. (5 Victory Royale winners and top 6 consistent teams).<br />\n<br />\nSession 3 will fill the new 11 vacant team spots with the 62nd-72nd teams on the Series Point Leaderboard. This new 50-team lobby will compete across six matches and advance 12 total teams to the Finals. (6 Victory Royale winners and top 6 consistent teams).&nbsp;<strong>Here‚Äôs a condensed description of how Finals advancement works for each day:</strong><br />\n<br />\nSession 1: 5 Matches; 2.5 Hours; 1st - 50th on the Series Points Leaderboard<br />\nSession 2: 5 Matches; 2.5 Hours; 1st - 61st on the Series Points Leaderboard<br />\nSession 3: 6 Matches; 3 Hours; 1st - 72nd on the Series Points Leaderboard<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"19BR Comp FNCS FormatExplainer BlogOnly 1920x1080\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/19br-comp-fncs-formatexplainer-blogonly-1920x1080-1920x1080-2ef8b42f9215.jpg\" style=\"height:auto; width:auto\" /></p>\n\n<h3>Finals (March 5-6)</h3>\n\n<p>The FNCS Finals will be a similar format as previous seasons, but with the new Match Point variable. A team can end the competition early by earning 500 total points and 3 Victory Royales. Once a team has met both of these thresholds, it will be declared the FNCS Champions. If no team meets both of these thresholds by the end of 12 games, the Finals will play out exactly how it has the past few seasons. Match Point will be extremely challenging to achieve, and is only reserved for a completely dominant performance for the first iteration.</p>\n\n<h3>Prize Pool</h3>\n\n<p>We‚Äôre keeping our FNCS seasonal prize pool relatively the same with a $3,008,500 shared prize pool for Chapter 3 Season 1. Here‚Äôs how the prize pool is broken down per region.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Prize Pool per Region</strong></p>\n\n<table cellspacing=\"0\">\n\t<colgroup>\n\t\t<col />\n\t\t<col />\n\t\t<col />\n\t\t<col />\n\t\t<col />\n\t\t<col />\n\t\t<col />\n\t</colgroup>\n\t<tbody>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t<p style=\"text-align:center\">EU</p>\n\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t<p style=\"text-align:center\">NAE</p>\n\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t<p style=\"text-align:center\">BR</p>\n\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t<p style=\"text-align:center\">NAW</p>\n\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t<p style=\"text-align:center\">ASIA</p>\n\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t<p style=\"text-align:center\">ME</p>\n\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t<p style=\"text-align:center\">OCE</p>\n\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t<p style=\"text-align:center\">$1,362,500</p>\n\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t<p style=\"text-align:center\">$637,500</p>\n\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t<p style=\"text-align:center\">$418,000</p>\n\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t<p style=\"text-align:center\">$239,500</p>\n\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t<p style=\"text-align:center\">$145,000</p>\n\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t<p style=\"text-align:center\">$114,000</p>\n\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t<p style=\"text-align:center\">$92,000</p>\n\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t</tbody>\n</table>\n\n<p><br />\nFor all the details on the Chapter 3 Season 1 FNCS competition, please read the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/competitive/news/fortnite-champion-series-chapter-3-season-1-official-rules\" target=\"_blank\">Chapter 3 Season 1 FNCS Official Rules</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 style=\"line-height:1.38; margin-bottom:5px; margin-top:21px\">FNCS Community Cup</h3>\n\n<p>Get into the FNCS spirit by competing in the Community Cup on February 28!</p>\n\n<p>This Duos event will have teams compete in 10 matches across three hours to try and earn the most points possible.

Additionally, players acknowledge that the different platforms may offer features, such as controllers, player interface, and/or ability to individualize certain game settings/sensitivities, etc., which may arguably provide a competitive advantage to one platform over another. Players acknowledge their sole competitive platform choice and agree and waive any responsibility or liability of Epic relating to such player‚Äôs involvement in a multiplatform competition, including any alleged competitive advantage of any other platform.<br />\n<br />\n6.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Communication<br />\n<br />\n6.1&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Event Administrators will be available to answer player-specific questions and provide additional assistance throughout the Event via the official player support channel found here: https://epicgames.helpshift.com/a/fortnite/?contact=1&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n7.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Post-Match Process<br />\n<br />\n7.1&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Scoring<br />\n<br />\n7.1.1&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The Game client will record and report a player‚Äôs score at the conclusion of such player‚Äôs participation in a match.<br />\n<br />\n7.1.2&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;At times, unforeseen issues may arise that result in score reporting delays and/or inaccuracies. For the duration of the Event, the score displayed within the Leaderboard will be the official score, regardless of accuracy.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n7.1.3&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Without limitation of the foregoing, after a Round has ended, it may be necessary to adjust the Leaderboard standings (typically due to players or teams being DQ‚Äôd and removed from the Leaderboard for breaking these Rules). For advancement purposes, at the end of the applicable Round, the Leaderboard standings will be snapshotted, and those advancements will be immediately awarded and considered ‚Äúfinal‚Äù for purposes of player or team advancement only, subject in all cases to final adjustment and confirmation by Epic.<br />\n<br />\n8.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Code of Conduct<br />\n<br />\n8.1&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Personal Conduct; No Toxic Behavior<br />\n<br />\n8.1.1&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;All players must conduct themselves in a way that is at all times consistent with (a) the Code of Conduct in this Section 8 (‚ÄúCode of Conduct‚Äù) and (b) the general principles of personal integrity, honesty, and good sportsmanship.<br />\n<br />\n8.1.2&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Players must be respectful of other players, Event Administrators, spectators, and sponsors (as applicable).<br />\n<br />\n8.1.3&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Players shall not behave in a manner (a) which violates these Rules, (b) which is disruptive, unsafe or destructive, or (c) which is otherwise harmful to the enjoyment of the Game by other users as intended by Epic (as decided by Epic).

For clarity, a player‚Äôs receipt of coaching or use of the in-game replay tool does not fall within this prohibition.<br />\n<br />\nIntentionally disconnecting from the Game after you or a member of your team takes damage. For clarity, this only applies to players who intentionally disconnect with a member of their team receiving damage within 60 seconds prior to the intentional disconnection.<br />\n<br />\n8.2.2&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Players may not work together to deceive or otherwise cheat other players during any match (‚ÄúCollusion‚Äù).

We still expect many regions to complete the FNCS Finals in its full 12-game length. We‚Äôre not committed to the final point thresholds yet, but we‚Äôll have this ready by the end of January.</p>\n\n<h3>Best-of Format</h3>\n\n<p>We‚Äôve been improving our tournament operations tools to work towards new tournament formats. We‚Äôd now like to share some early details for one of the first of these new tournament formats that we intend to release this year: the Best-of Format.<br />\n<br />\nUnder the Best-of Format, a player‚Äôs best games from a given set would be counted towards an individual or team score. For example, if you have three hours to compete in up to 10 total matches, this format could be used to only count the best seven matches out of the possible 10. We‚Äôll look to introduce this format in the right way in 2022.</p>\n\n<h2>FNCS Semi-Finals Format (Recap)</h2>\n\n<p>We would also like to clarify any questions or confusion surrounding the process of qualifying from the FNCS Semi-Finals.<br />\n<br />\nThe FNCS Semi-Finals will be a single lobby - the top 50 teams on the Regional FNCS Series Leaderboard to start. After each session, the vacant spots will be filled with the teams next up on the Series Leaderboard. To make it past the FNCS Semi-Finals, teams need to either win a single match during any of the three session periods, or be one of the top consistent teams across one single session. We are currently planning Sessions 1 and 2 to consist of 5 games each and Session 3 will be 6 games.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2>December 2021 Tournament Break&nbsp;</h2>\n\n<p>The normal competitive reevaluation period coupled with the timing of the new Fortnite Chapter (new weapons, Island, and new engine with Unreal Engine 5), on top of the much needed Holiday time off for players and employees did not allow us to squeeze in any additional competitions in December. We look forward to seeing you all competing in 2022.</p>\n\n<h2>Increased Integrity for 2022</h2>\n\n<p>In 2022 we‚Äôll be increasing our tournament integrity by reevaluating rulings for all competitive official rule violations . Our rules, our competitors, and the competitive scene have been established long enough for us to feel comfortable increasing the sanctions for &nbsp;rule violations. Continue to play fair and abide by our rules to avoid any action against your account. Additionally, all tournaments will now require a minimum account level of 50 (previously 30) to participate. Premiere tournaments such as FNCS will also require an even higher minimum account level of 100.<br />\n<br />\nThere‚Äôs still plenty more coming in 2022 that we‚Äôll announce at a later date. We hope you enjoy the new Chapter and take time to recharge with your family and loved ones this Holiday season. Our regular tournament offerings will begin in early January. See you then!</p>\n","description":"Please read clarifications about the new Fortnite Competitive updates for 2022 covering Competitive Formats, FNCS Semi-Finals, and infraction penalties.","date":"2021-12-15T18:28:00.000Z","trending":false,"images":{"image":"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/18br-comp-ltmcup-newsthumb-576x576-e4b11e285b03.jpg","share":null,"trending":"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/18br-comp-ltmcup-newsheader-1900x600-a74ff18edf8e.jpg"},"author":"The Fortnite Team","url":"https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/competitive/news/fortnite-competitive-december-2021-update","nextPost":"https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/competitive/blog/earn-up-to-three-sprays-in-the-all-valley-cup-in-fortnite","prevPost":"https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/competitive/blog/moxie-cup-chapter-3-season-1-official-rules"},{"id":"54ece23a-bf01-49cb-90bc-98c02ee65b74","title":"Moxie Cup - Chapter 3 Season 1 Official Rules","content":"Moxie Cup - Chapter 3 Season 1 Official Rules<br />\n<br />\n1.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Introduction and Acceptance<br />\n<br />\n1.1&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Introduction<br />\n<br />\nThese Moxie Cup Official Rules (‚ÄúRules‚Äù) govern all stages of the Moxie Cup (‚ÄúMoxie Cup‚Äù) or Event (‚ÄúEvent‚Äù).<br />\n<br />\nThese Rules have been designed to ensure the integrity of competitive play of Fortnite (the ‚ÄúGame‚Äù) in connection with the Event, and are intended to promote vigorous competition and to help ensure that all competitive play of the Game is fun, fair, and free from Toxic Behavior (as defined below).<br />\n<br />\n1.2&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Acceptance<br />\n<br />\nTo participate in the Event, each player must agree (or, if a Minor (as defined below), such player‚Äôs parent or legal guardian must agree on such player‚Äôs behalf) to follow these Rules at all times, including the Code of Conduct in Section 8.

Epic reserves the right to cancel or suspend the Event in its sole discretion or due to circumstances beyond its control, including natural disasters. Epic may disqualify any player from participating in the Event or winning a prize if, in its sole discretion, it determines such player is attempting to undermine the legitimate operation of the Event by cheating, hacking, deception, or any other unfair playing practices intending to annoy, abuse, threaten, undermine, or harass any other players or Epic‚Äôs representatives. The internal laws of the State of North Carolina, without reference to any of its conflicts of laws principles, shall govern disputes regarding these Rules and/or the Event.

There‚Äôs a lot to cover, so we‚Äôll briefly highlight the top changes before talking more in-depth about the entire year.</p>\n\n<h2>What to Expect for Fortnite Competitive in 2022</h2>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">FNCS Duos with a Match Point format in Finals</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">Divisional tournaments</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">2-Round Cash Cups</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">Proposals for in-person 3rd party events are being reviewed for approvals once again</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">More Competitive features</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>A New Competitive Mode and FNCS Format</h2>\n\n<p>A full year of Trios achieved our goal of a consistent and stable yearly game mode for the best players. However, in 2022, we‚Äôll be shaking it up and switching to Duos for the primary Competitive game mode in Fortnite. The next FNCS will begin in February, so make sure you‚Äôve got your Duo partner lined up and ready to go by then.</p>\n\n<p>With the new game mode, we‚Äôll also be featuring an updated format for qualification in FNCS. We found that two qualifiers is the right number to narrow down Fortnite‚Äôs best in each region. This will allow us to provide additional competitions and events outside FNCS, while giving us even more scheduling flexibility. We‚Äôll still have direct qualification to Finals from Qualifiers, and Series Points will be used for Semi-Finals advancement. Each Qualifier will also be narrowed down to three rounds from four rounds, and both Qualifiers will run during the same week.</p>\n\n<p>This past season we‚Äôve experimented with highly valuing the Victory Royale in Semi-Finals. Our intent is to continue to explore ways to provide extra value for obtaining a Victory Royale in set-lobbies where we can. We want to continue to lean into those big moments for all players and fans, regardless if you‚Äôve watched 100 tournaments, or you‚Äôre just catching your very first one.</p>\n\n<p>With this in mind, our FNCS Semi-Finals and Finals have some significant changes planned for next year, incorporating some new tournament technology to support our goals of highly valuing Victory Royales but also taking into account player and fan feedback.</p>\n\n<p>Semi-Finals will now consist of only a single Heat (a single lobby) with matches on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday in Week 2.The winning Duo of each Semi-Finals match will continue to be rewarded with an instant advancement to Finals. New tournament technology in next season will also advance the top consistent teams who haven‚Äôt already grabbed a Victory Royale at the end of each of those daily Semi Finals sessions. After each daily session, those now vacant spots in the Heat will be back-filled with the next in-line Duos on the Series Leaderboard and the process will start again the following day. This will repeat until all 50 Duos spots have been filled in for Finals.</p>\n\n<p>For Finals in Week 3, we‚Äôre introducing another new piece of tournament technology, called the ‚ÄúMatch Point‚Äù format. This will mean that a team may end the Finals tournament window early and be crowned FNCS Champions if they accomplish both of the following:</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">Reach the designated points threshold</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">Earn two* Victory Royales</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>If no team accomplishes these two requirements, the tournament will end at its normally scheduled time and then we‚Äôll crown our FNCS Champions.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Our main goal with implementing this new technology is to continue down the path where Victory Royales deliver a huge impact for any given match, while balancing single match wins carefully with consistent tournament placement and eliminations. We plan to make the points threshold significant enough so that the likelihood of the Finals ending early on Day 1 is low. We want closing out an FNCS tournament early to be an uncommon and exciting occurrence, with major clout rights.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>We expect these changes to pair well with the natural tempo of a broadcast, and is a unique way to ensure the last game of FNCS ultimately decides the FNCS winner in each region.<br />\n<br />\n*Our team is currently looking at a lot of historical data to make sure we get these threshold numbers right, and we should have more to share in the coming months.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2>More Changes to Cash Cups</h2>\n\n<p>Fortnite Competitive is for anyone who wants to compete and we‚Äôre excited to share our plans for divisional tournaments in 2022. While we‚Äôll continue Cash Cups for Champion League players, we‚Äôll also run simultaneous tournaments for Contender and Open League players to get more tournament and Hype-earning opportunities against other players in your division. As our tournament tools improve, we plan to incorporate the divisional aspect in more tournaments beyond Cash Cups.</p>\n\n<p>We‚Äôre making Cash Cups themselves more competitive with each consisting of two rounds, where the second rounds will be held on a seperate day in the week. We think this will improve the quality and integrity of these tournaments while cash prizes are on the line.</p>\n\n<h2>3rd Party In-Person Fortnite Tournaments</h2>\n\n<p>We‚Äôre excited to announce that we are once again accepting proposals for third-party in-person events featuring Fortnite on a case-by-case basis. All approvals will be subject to applicable public health guidelines and restrictions that may be in place. We‚Äôll keep you updated on those plans as they are finalized.</p>\n\n<h2>More Competitive Features</h2>\nThis past year we experimented with Creative Arena modes and Arena Fill, altered the Arena points format, added broadcast features, and added cumulative point totals for two-day events, among other improvements to the Competitive ecosystem. You can expect additional changes coming in 2022 to tournament features, the official broadcast, and the Arena system. We‚Äôre not quite ready to share all the details on everything we‚Äôve got planned - we still want some things to be a surprise - but we are committed to making additional changes across the board this season.<br />\n<br />\n2022 is shaping up to be the best year of Fortnite competition yet!","description":"Read about the exciting plans and changes for Fortnite Competitive in 2022!

Any team found to have violated the terms of this Section will be subject to disciplinary actions as further described in Section 9.2.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nAt the conclusion of the Victory Path Session 4, teams that do not advance to the Finals from the Victory Path Session 4 will be awarded Consistency Points based on the scoring system listed in Sections 2.5.3 or 2.5.7 (as applicable). The total Consistency Points awarded to such teams at the conclusion of each Victory Path session will be added together across all four (4) sessions. The team with the highest cumulative total of Consistency Points in its respective Region will advance and be able to queue up for its respective Region‚Äôs Finals. It will not be possible to enter the Finals without advancing from the Victory Path or by Consistency Points as set out in these Rules.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nIn the Finals, teams will compete in two (2) sessions during their respective Region‚Äôs Finals windows as listed in-game. Points earned from each session will be added together to determine the total score for the Finals. &nbsp;Teams may participate in a maximum of six (6) matches during each Finals session for a total maximum of twelve (12) matches across the Finals. Each Finals session will last approximately three (3) hours, with a new match starting every thirty (30) minutes. If a team fails to queue for the playlist and/or misses the start time for a given match, it will be considered to have finished in (or tied for) last place with zero eliminations for that missed match. Teams will earn points based on the scoring system listed in Sections 2.5.4. 2.5.5, or 2.5.6 (as applicable). Matches for the Finals will count only if the match begins before the Finals session window closes.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nFor clarity, teams may only participate in a single Region‚Äôs Finals session.<br />\n<br />\nAt the conclusion of the Finals, and subject to the terms and conditions herein, the top point earning teams as listed on the in-game leaderboard (‚ÄúLeaderboard‚Äù) from each Region will be awarded prizes as set out in Section 2.7.1.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n2.5.2&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Scoring System - Load Session and Reload Sessions 1, 2, and 3<br />\n<br />\nPlacement<br />\n<br />\nVictory Royale: 25 Points<br />\n2nd: 20 Points<br />\n3rd: 16 Points<br />\n4th: 14 Points<br />\n5th: 13 Points<br />\n6th: 12 Points<br />\n7th: 11 Points<br />\n8th: 10 Points<br />\n9th: 9 Points<br />\n10th: 8 Points<br />\n11th: 7 Points<br />\n12th: 6 Points<br />\n13th: 5 Points<br />\n14th 4 Points<br />\n15th: 3 Points<br />\n16th: 2 Points<br />\n17th: 1 Point<br />\n<br />\nEach Elimination: 1 Point<br />\n<br />\n2.5.3&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Scoring System - Victory Path (to determine Consistency Points)<br />\n<br />\nPlacement<br />\n<br />\nVictory Royale: 1000 Points<br />\n2nd: 26 Points<br />\n3rd: 24 Points<br />\n4th: 22 Points<br />\n5th: 21 Points<br />\n6th: 20 Points<br />\n7th: 19 Points<br />\n8th: 18 Points<br />\n9th: 17 Points<br />\n10th: 16 Points<br />\n11th: 14 Points<br />\n12th: 13 Points<br />\n13th: 12 Points<br />\n14th 11 Points<br />\n15th: 10 Points<br />\n16th: 9 Points<br />\n17th: 8 Points<br />\n18th - 24th: 5 Points<br />\n<br />\nEach Elimination: 1 Points<br />\n<br />\n2.5.4&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Consistency Points Scoring System (Victory Path)<br />\n<br />\nConsistency Points are awarded to teams that do not achieve a Victory Royale during Victory Path Session 1, 2, 3, and/or 4 by the conclusion of the applicable Victory Path session.

Except as otherwise expressly set forth herein, all of the Event Administrators‚Äô rights pursuant to these Rules relate to and are exercisable against the team as a whole and each individual member of the team.

Except as otherwise determined by Epic in its sole discretion, any technical issues or Bug encounters, whether defined in this Section 5 or not, must be played through and will not be cause for a remake.<br />\n<br />\n5.2.2 &nbsp; &nbsp;Without limitation of the foregoing, players are prohibited from taking advantage of or otherwise exploiting any Bug that allows a player to participate in any Event round or stage without having first qualified for such round or stage pursuant to the terms of these Rules.<br />\n<br />\n5.2.3 &nbsp; &nbsp;In addition, players acknowledge and agree that in participating in a Game competitive event the individual player solely determines which platform to use (i.e., PC, console, or mobile (as applicable)) and understands that he/she may face players competing on a different platform. Additionally, players acknowledge that the different platforms may offer features, such as controllers, player interface, and/or ability to individualize certain game settings/sensitivities, etc., which may arguably provide a competitive advantage to one platform over another. Players acknowledge their sole competitive platform choice and agree and waive any responsibility or liability of Epic relating to such player‚Äôs involvement in a multiplatform competition, including any alleged competitive advantage of any other platform.<br />\n<br />\n6.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Communication<br />\n<br />\n6.1&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;FNCS Grand Royale&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nEvent Administrators will be available to answer player-specific questions and provide additional assistance throughout the Load Session, Reload Sessions, Victory Path Sessions, and Finals via the official player Discord Server.<br />\n<br />\n7. &nbsp; &nbsp;Post-Match Process<br />\n<br />\n7.1 &nbsp; &nbsp;Scoring<br />\n<br />\n7.1.1 &nbsp; &nbsp;The Game client will record and report a player‚Äôs score at the conclusion of such player‚Äôs participation in a match.<br />\n<br />\n7.1.2 &nbsp; &nbsp;At times, unforeseen issues may arise that result in score reporting delays and/or inaccuracies. For the duration of the Event, the score displayed within the Leaderboard will be the official score, regardless of accuracy.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n7.1.3 &nbsp; &nbsp;Without limitation of the foregoing, after a Round has ended, it may be necessary to adjust the Leaderboard standings (typically due to players or teams being DQ‚Äôd and removed from the Leaderboard for breaking these Rules). For advancement purposes, at the end of the applicable Round, the Leaderboard standings will be snapshotted, and those advancements will be immediately awarded and considered ‚Äúfinal‚Äù for purposes of player or team advancement only, subject in all cases to final adjustment and confirmation by Epic.<br />\n<br />\n8. &nbsp; &nbsp;Code of Conduct<br />\n<br />\n8.1 &nbsp; &nbsp;Personal Conduct; No Toxic Behavior<br />\n<br />\n8.1.1 &nbsp; &nbsp;All players must conduct themselves in a way that is at all times consistent with (a) the Code of Conduct in this Section 8 (‚ÄúCode of Conduct‚Äù) and (b) the general principles of personal integrity, honesty, and good sportsmanship.<br />\n<br />\n8.1.2 &nbsp; &nbsp;Players must be respectful of other players, Event Administrators, spectators, and sponsors (as applicable).<br />\n<br />\n8.1.3 &nbsp; &nbsp;Players shall not behave in a manner (a) which violates these Rules, (b) which is disruptive, unsafe or destructive, or (c) which is otherwise harmful to the enjoyment of the Game by other users as intended by Epic (as decided by Epic). In particular, players shall not engage in harassing or disrespectful conduct, use of abusive or offensive language, game sabotage, spamming, social engineering, scamming, or any unlawful activity (‚ÄúToxic Behavior‚Äù).<br />\n<br />\n8.1.4 &nbsp; &nbsp;Players shall not (a) proclaim to be, or represent themselves as, a banned player or a cheater/rule breaker, or (b) glorify or otherwise endorse the breaking or violation of these Rules.<br />\n<br />\n8.1.5 &nbsp; &nbsp;Any violation of these Rules may expose a player to disciplinary action as further described in Section 9.2, whether or not that violation was committed intentionally.<br />\n<br />\n8.2 &nbsp; &nbsp;Competitive Integrity<br />\n<br />\n8.2.1 &nbsp; &nbsp;Each player is expected to play within the spirit of the Game and these Rules at all times during any Event match. &nbsp;Any form of unfair play is prohibited by these Rules, and may result in disciplinary action. &nbsp;Examples of unfair play include the following:<br />\n<br />\nCollusion (as defined below), match fixing or throwing, bribing a referee or match official, or any other unfair or illegal action or agreement to intentionally influence (or attempt to influence) the outcome of any match or Event.<br />\n<br />\nHacking or otherwise modifying the intended behavior of the Game client.<br />\n<br />\nPlaying or allowing another player to play on an Epic account registered in another person‚Äôs name (or soliciting, encouraging, or directing someone else to do so).<br />\n<br />\nUsing any kind of cheating device, program, or similar cheating method to gain a competitive advantage.<br />\n<br />\nIntentionally exploiting any game function (e.g., an in-game bug or glitch) in a manner not intended by Epic in order to gain a competitive advantage.<br />\n<br />\nUsing distributed denial of service attacks, swatting, or similar methods to interfere with another player‚Äôs connection to the Game‚Äôs game client.<br />\n<br />\nUsing macro keys or similar methods to automate in-game actions.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nAccepting any gift, reward, bribe, or compensation for services promised, rendered, or to be rendered in connection with unfair play of the Game (e.g., services designed to throw or fix a match or session).<br />\n<br />\nUtilizing outside assistance regarding the location of other players, other players‚Äô health or equipment, or any other information not otherwise known to the player by the information on his or her own screen (e.g., looking at or attempting to look at spectator monitors while currently in a match). For clarity, a player‚Äôs receipt of coaching or use of the in-game replay tool does not fall within this prohibition.<br />\n<br />\nIntentionally disconnecting from the Game after you or a member of your team takes damage. For clarity, this only applies to players who intentionally disconnect with a member of their team receiving damage within 60 seconds prior to the intentional disconnection.<br />\n<br />\n8.2.2 &nbsp; &nbsp;Players may not work together to deceive or otherwise cheat other players during any match (‚ÄúCollusion‚Äù).

Any player found to have withheld, destroyed, or tampered with any related information, or otherwise found to have misled Epic and/or an Event Administrator during an investigation, will be subject to disciplinary action as further described in Section 9.2.<br />\n<br />\n9.2 &nbsp; &nbsp;Disciplinary Action<br />\n<br />\n9.2.1 &nbsp; &nbsp;If Epic decides that a player has violated the Code, Epic may take the following disciplinary actions (as applicable):<br />\n<br />\nIssue a private or public warning (verbal or written) to the player;<br />\n<br />\nLoss of session points for the current or future match(es);<br />\n<br />\nLoss of all or any part of the prizes previously awarded to the player;<br />\n<br />\nDisqualify the player from participating in one or more matches and/or sessions at the Event; or<br />\n<br />\nPrevent the player from participating in one or more future competitions hosted by Epic.<br />\n<br />\n9.2.2 &nbsp; &nbsp;For clarity, the nature and extent of the disciplinary action taken by Epic pursuant to this Section 9.2 will be in the sole and absolute discretion of Epic. Epic reserves the right to seek damages and other remedies from such player to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nThe enforcement of any applicable punishment by Epic shall not provide such player with grounds for claims against Epic under any theory of law, or otherwise be considered a liability on the part of Epic to such player.<br />\n<br />\n9.2.3 &nbsp; &nbsp;If Epic decides that there have been repeated breaches of these Rules by a player, it may hand out increasing disciplinary action, up to and including permanent disqualification from all future competitive play of the Game. &nbsp;Epic may also enforce any applicable penalty specified in Epic‚Äôs Terms of Service and/or the Fortnite EULA.<br />\n<br />\n9.2.4 &nbsp; &nbsp;All Rules violations at the Event will be governed by the Epic Competitive Penalty Matrix. A final decision by Epic as to the appropriate disciplinary action will be final and binding on all players.<br />\n<br />\n9.3 &nbsp; &nbsp;Rule Disputes<br />\n<br />\nEpic has final, binding authority to decide all disputes with respect to any portion of these Rules, including the breach, enforcement, or interpretation thereof.<br />\n<br />\n10. &nbsp; &nbsp;Conditions<br />\n<br />\nThe Event is subject to these Rules. By participating, each player agrees (or, if a Minor, such player‚Äôs parent or legal guardian agrees on such player‚Äôs behalf): (a) to be bound by these complete Rules (including the Code of Conduct) and the decisions of Epic which shall be final and binding; and (b) to waive any right to claim ambiguity in the Event or these Rules, except where prohibited by applicable law. By accepting a prize, the Winning Player agrees (or, if a Minor, such Winning Player‚Äôs parent or legal guardian agrees on such Winning Player‚Äôs behalf) to release Epic from any and all liability, loss, or damage arising from or in connection with awarding, receipt, and/or use or misuse of prize or participation in any prize-related activities. Epic shall not be liable for: (i) telephone system, telephone, or computer hardware, software, or other technical or computer malfunctions, lost connections, disconnections, delays, or transmission errors; (ii) data corruption, theft, destruction, and unauthorized access to or alteration of entry or other materials; (iii) any injuries, losses, or damages of any kind, including death caused by the prize or resulting from acceptance, possession, or use of a prize, or from participation in the Event; or (iv) any printing, typographical, administrative, or technological errors in any materials associated with the Event. Epic reserves the right to cancel or suspend the Event in its sole discretion or due to circumstances beyond its control, including natural disasters. Epic may disqualify any player from participating in the Event or winning a prize if, in its sole discretion, it determines such player is attempting to undermine the legitimate operation of the Event by cheating, hacking, deception, or any other unfair playing practices intending to annoy, abuse, threaten, undermine, or harass any other players or Epic‚Äôs representatives. The internal laws of the State of North Carolina, without reference to any of its conflicts of laws principles, shall govern disputes regarding these Rules and/or the Event. Epic may, in its sole discretion, cancel, modify, or suspend the Event should a virus, bug, computer problem, unauthorized intervention, force majeure, or other cause beyond Epic‚Äôs control corrupt the administration, security, or proper play of the Event. Any attempt to deliberately damage or undermine the legitimate operation of the Event may be in violation of criminal and civil laws and will result in disqualification from participation in the Event. &nbsp;Should such an attempt be made, Epic reserves the right to seek remedies and damages (including attorneys‚Äô fees) to the fullest extent of the law, including criminal prosecution. The Event is subject to all applicable federal, state, and local laws.<br />\n<br />\n11.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Publicity; Interview Consent<br />\n<br />\n11.1&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Epic reserves the right to use the name, tag, likeness, audio, video, game play statistics, and/or Epic account ID of any player, for publicity purposes prior to, during, or after the Event end date, in any media, throughout the world, in perpetuity, but only in connection with publicizing the Event or other Game events and programing, without any compensation or prior review unless specifically prohibited by law.<br />\n<br />\n11.2&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Epic may, from time to time, reach out to players looking to build their personal brands as competitive Fortnite players for an opportunity to voluntarily participate in an interview in connection with the Event (each, an ‚ÄúInterview‚Äù). Such players recognize that Epic is not required to feature such players and their game play or make them famous, but to the extent any such player wants Epic to have the rights to do that, such player (and if a Minor, such player‚Äôs parent or legal guardian) declares and affirms the following:<br />\n<br />\nYou understand that to the extent you agree (and if a Minor, your parent or legal guardian agrees) that you will participate in an Interview, (a) your participation in such Interview will be on a voluntary basis; and (b) Epic will collect a recorded verbal confirmation from you (or if a Minor, your parent or legal guardian) prior to conducting such Interview.<br />\n<br />\nIn connection with your participation in the Interview, you hereby grant (or, if a Minor, your parent or legal guardian hereby grants) to Epic a royalty-free, worldwide right and license (with the right to grant sublicenses) to copy, display, distribute, edit, host, store and otherwise use and display your name, likeness, image, voice, video, game play statistics, and biographical information (collectively, ‚ÄúInterview Materials‚Äù), and create derivative works of the Interview Materials, in any and all present and future media, on or in connection with (i) the streaming of the Interview Materials; and (ii) Epic‚Äôs marketing and promotion of the Event (if any), in each case (items (i) and (ii)), without any compensation or prior review unless specifically prohibited by law.

This means an eligible player may make a full Trio with any two players who are otherwise eligible to participate, regardless if those players have made a single-lobby round of FNCS this year. Select your teammates wisely. Once you‚Äôve started the FNCS Grand Royale with a team, you cannot change teams for the remainder of the event.\n<h2>FNCS Grand Royale Prize Pool</h2>\nHere‚Äôs the quick breakdown of the Prize Pool for each region.

The competition will take place across two separate weekends. The first weekend (November 11-14) is reserved for the qualifying stages and the second weekend (November 19-21) is the Finals. <em>Dates listed below are for all server regions besides the Middle East region. The Middle East region‚Äôs competition dates are one day earlier than listed below.</em>\n\n<h3>Load Session - November 12</h3>\nThe competition begins with an open 3-hour session where teams have up to 10 matches to earn as many points as possible. From there, teams will be placed on two paths, the Victory Path (top 33 teams) and the Reload Path (everyone else). The Load Session and Reload Path will follow this scoring format:<br />\n<br />\nVictory Royale: 25 Points<br />\n2nd: 20 Points<br />\n3rd: 16 Points<br />\n4th: 14 Points<br />\n5th: 13 Points<br />\n6th: 12 Points<br />\n7th: 11 Points<br />\n8th: 10 Points<br />\n9th: 9 Points<br />\n10th: 8 Points<br />\n11th: 7 Points<br />\n12th: 6 Points<br />\n13th: 5 Points<br />\n14th: 4 Points<br />\n15th: 3 Points<br />\n16th: 2 Points<br />\n17th: 1 Point<br />\n<br />\nEach Elimination: 1 Point\n<h2>Victory Path</h2>\nThe Victory Path will have four separate sessions that consist of eight games each. The team that earns the Victory Royale in each game will advance to the Finals. At the conclusion of a session, the next Victory Path session will be filled with the top 8 teams from the previous Reload Session to make a full lobby of 33 teams again. At the end of each session, teams will receive Consistency Points and the team with the most cumulative Consistency Points at the conclusion of the Victory Path sessions will advance as the 33rd team in the Finals.<br />\n<br />\n9th Place - 20 Consistency Points<br />\n10th Place - 15 Consistency Points<br />\n11th Place - 10 Consistency Points<br />\n12th Place - 8 Consistency Points<br />\n13th Place - 6 Consistency Points<br />\n14th Place - 4 Consistency Points<br />\n15th Place - 3 Consistency Points<br />\n16th Place - 2 Consistency Points<br />\n17th Place - 1 Consistency Points\n<h2>Reload Path</h2>\nAll teams that did not advance to the Victory Path will be placed in the Reload Path. Teams will have three separate opportunities to place in the top 8 of a single session (3 hours and up to 10 matches) in order to advance to the Victory Path.<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"FNCSGrandRoyale\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fncsgrandroyale-699x682-87383b62d0c6.PNG\" style=\"height:auto; width:auto\" />\n<h2>FNCS Grand Royale Finals - November 20-21</h2>\nThe Finals will take place across two days with a slight twist to what you may be used to in an FNCS Finals.

Additionally, players acknowledge that the different platforms may offer features, such as controllers, player interface, and/or ability to individualize certain game settings/sensitivities, etc., which may arguably provide a competitive advantage to one platform over another.

Except as otherwise determined by Epic in its sole discretion, any technical issues or Bug encounters, whether defined in this Section 5 or not, must be played through and will not be cause for a remake.<br />\n<br />\n5.2.2 &nbsp; &nbsp;Without limitation of the foregoing, players are prohibited from taking advantage of or otherwise exploiting any Bug that allows a player to participate in any Event round or stage without having first qualified for such round or stage pursuant to the terms of these Rules.<br />\n<br />\n5.2.3 &nbsp; &nbsp;In addition, players acknowledge and agree that in participating in a Game competitive event the individual player solely determines which platform to use (i.e., PC, console, or mobile (as applicable)) and understands that he/she may face players competing on a different platform. Additionally, players acknowledge that the different platforms may offer features, such as controllers, player interface, and/or ability to individualize certain game settings/sensitivities, etc., which may arguably provide a competitive advantage to one platform over another. Players acknowledge their sole competitive platform choice and agree and waive any responsibility or liability of Epic relating to such player‚Äôs involvement in a multiplatform competition, including any alleged competitive advantage of any other platform.<br />\n<br />\n6. &nbsp; &nbsp;Communication<br />\n<br />\n6.1 &nbsp; &nbsp;Event Administrators will be available to answer player-specific questions and provide additional assistance throughout the Event via the official player support channel found here: https://epicgames.helpshift.com/a/fortnite/?contact=1&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n7. &nbsp; &nbsp;Post-Match Process<br />\n<br />\n7.1 &nbsp; &nbsp;Scoring<br />\n<br />\n7.1.1 &nbsp; &nbsp;The Game client will record and report a player‚Äôs score at the conclusion of such player‚Äôs participation in a match.<br />\n<br />\n7.1.2 &nbsp; &nbsp;At times, unforeseen issues may arise that result in score reporting delays and/or inaccuracies. For the duration of the Event, the score displayed within the Leaderboard will be the official score, regardless of accuracy.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n7.1.3 &nbsp; &nbsp;Without limitation of the foregoing, after a Round has ended, it may be necessary to adjust the Leaderboard standings (typically due to players or teams being DQ‚Äôd and removed from the Leaderboard for breaking these Rules). For advancement purposes, at the end of the applicable Round, the Leaderboard standings will be snapshotted, and those advancements will be immediately awarded and considered ‚Äúfinal‚Äù for purposes of player or team advancement only, subject in all cases to final adjustment and confirmation by Epic.<br />\n<br />\n8. &nbsp; &nbsp;Code of Conduct<br />\n<br />\n8.1 &nbsp; &nbsp;Personal Conduct; No Toxic Behavior<br />\n<br />\n8.1.1 &nbsp; &nbsp;All players must conduct themselves in a way that is at all times consistent with (a) the Code of Conduct in this Section 8 (‚ÄúCode of Conduct‚Äù) and (b) the general principles of personal integrity, honesty, and good sportsmanship.<br />\n<br />\n8.1.2 &nbsp; &nbsp;Players must be respectful of other players, Event Administrators, spectators, and sponsors (as applicable).<br />\n<br />\n8.1.3 &nbsp; &nbsp;Players shall not behave in a manner (a) which violates these Rules, (b) which is disruptive, unsafe or destructive, or (c) which is otherwise harmful to the enjoyment of the Game by other users as intended by Epic (as decided by Epic).

For clarity, a player‚Äôs receipt of coaching or use of the in-game replay tool does not fall within this prohibition.<br />\n<br />\nIntentionally disconnecting from the Game after you or a member of your team takes damage. For clarity, this only applies to players who intentionally disconnect with a member of their team receiving damage within 60 seconds prior to the intentional disconnection.<br />\n<br />\n8.2.2 &nbsp; &nbsp;Players may not work together to deceive or otherwise cheat other players during any match (‚ÄúCollusion‚Äù).

All complaints reported pursuant to this Section 8.4.2 will be promptly investigated and appropriate action will be taken. Retaliation against any player who brings forward a complaint or cooperates in the investigation of a complaint is prohibited.<br />\n<br />\n8.5 &nbsp; &nbsp;Confidentiality<br />\n<br />\nA player may not disclose to any third party any confidential information provided by the Event Administrators, Epic, or its affiliates concerning the Game, the Event, Epic, or its affiliates, by any method of communication, including by posting on social media channels.<br />\n<br />\n8.6 &nbsp; &nbsp;Illegal Conduct<br />\n<br />\nPlayers are required to comply with all applicable laws at all times.<br />\n<br />\n9. &nbsp; &nbsp;Rules and Conduct Violations<br />\n<br />\n9.1 &nbsp; &nbsp;Investigation and Compliance<br />\n<br />\nPlayers agree to fully cooperate with Epic and/or an Event Administrator (as applicable) in the investigation of any violation of these Rules. If Epic and/or an Event Administrator contacts a player to discuss the investigation, the player must be truthful in the information that he or she provides to Epic and/or an Event Administrator. Any player found to have withheld, destroyed, or tampered with any related information, or otherwise found to have misled Epic and/or an Event Administrator during an investigation, will be subject to disciplinary action as further described in Section 9.2.<br />\n<br />\n9.2 &nbsp; &nbsp;Disciplinary Action<br />\n<br />\n9.2.1 &nbsp; &nbsp;If Epic decides that a player has violated the Code, Epic may take the following disciplinary actions (as applicable):<br />\n<br />\nIssue a private or public warning (verbal or written) to the player;<br />\n<br />\nLoss of session points for the current or future match(es);<br />\n<br />\nLoss of all or any part of the prizes previously awarded to the player;<br />\n<br />\nDisqualify the player from participating in one or more matches and/or sessions at the Event; or<br />\n<br />\nPrevent the player from participating in one or more future competitions hosted by Epic.<br />\n<br />\n9.2.2 &nbsp; &nbsp;For clarity, the nature and extent of the disciplinary action taken by Epic pursuant to this Section 9.2 will be in the sole and absolute discretion of Epic. Epic reserves the right to seek damages and other remedies from such player to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nThe enforcement of any applicable punishment by Epic shall not provide such player with grounds for claims against Epic under any theory of law, or otherwise be considered a liability on the part of Epic to such player.<br />\n<br />\n9.2.3 &nbsp; &nbsp;If Epic decides that there have been repeated breaches of these Rules by a player, it may hand out increasing disciplinary action, up to and including permanent disqualification from all future competitive play of the Game. &nbsp;Epic may also enforce any applicable penalty specified in Epic‚Äôs Terms of Service and/or the Fortnite EULA.<br />\n<br />\n9.2.4 &nbsp; &nbsp;All Rules violations at the Event will be governed by the Epic Competitive Penalty Matrix. A final decision by Epic as to the appropriate disciplinary action will be final and binding on all players.<br />\n<br />\n9.3 &nbsp; &nbsp;Rule Disputes<br />\n<br />\nEpic has final, binding authority to decide all disputes with respect to any portion of these Rules, including the breach, enforcement, or interpretation thereof.<br />\n<br />\n10. &nbsp; &nbsp;Conditions<br />\n<br />\nThe Event is subject to these Rules. By participating, each player agrees (or, if a Minor, such player‚Äôs parent or legal guardian agrees on such player‚Äôs behalf): (a) to be bound by these complete Rules (including the Code of Conduct) and the decisions of Epic which shall be final and binding; and (b) to waive any right to claim ambiguity in the Event or these Rules, except where prohibited by applicable law. By accepting a prize, the Winning Player agrees (or, if a Minor, such Winning Player‚Äôs parent or legal guardian agrees on such Winning Player‚Äôs behalf) to release Epic from any and all liability, loss, or damage arising from or in connection with awarding, receipt, and/or use or misuse of prize or participation in any prize-related activities. Epic shall not be liable for: (i) telephone system, telephone, or computer hardware, software, or other technical or computer malfunctions, lost connections, disconnections, delays, or transmission errors; (ii) data corruption, theft, destruction, and unauthorized access to or alteration of entry or other materials; (iii) any injuries, losses, or damages of any kind, including death caused by the prize or resulting from acceptance, possession, or use of a prize, or from participation in the Event; or (iv) any printing, typographical, administrative, or technological errors in any materials associated with the Event. Epic reserves the right to cancel or suspend the Event in its sole discretion or due to circumstances beyond its control, including natural disasters. Epic may disqualify any player from participating in the Event or winning a prize if, in its sole discretion, it determines such player is attempting to undermine the legitimate operation of the Event by cheating, hacking, deception, or any other unfair playing practices intending to annoy, abuse, threaten, undermine, or harass any other players or Epic‚Äôs representatives. The internal laws of the State of North Carolina, without reference to any of its conflicts of laws principles, shall govern disputes regarding these Rules and/or the Event. Epic may, in its sole discretion, cancel, modify, or suspend the Event should a virus, bug, computer problem, unauthorized intervention, force majeure, or other cause beyond Epic‚Äôs control corrupt the administration, security, or proper play of the Event. Any attempt to deliberately damage or undermine the legitimate operation of the Event may be in violation of criminal and civil laws and will result in disqualification from participation in the Event. &nbsp;Should such an attempt be made, Epic reserves the right to seek remedies and damages (including attorneys‚Äô fees) to the fullest extent of the law, including criminal prosecution. The Event is subject to all applicable federal, state, and local laws.<br />\n<br />\n11. &nbsp; &nbsp;Publicity<br />\n<br />\nEpic reserves the right to use the name, tag, likeness, audio, video, game play statistics, and/or Epic account ID of any player, for publicity purposes prior to, during, or after the Event end date, in any media, throughout the world, in perpetuity, but only in connection with publicizing the Event or other Game events and programing, without any compensation or prior review unless specifically prohibited by law.<br />\n<br />\n12. &nbsp; &nbsp;Waiver of Jury Trial<br />\n<br />\nEXCEPT AS PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW AND AS A CONDITION OF PARTICIPATING IN THIS EVENT, EACH PARTICIPANT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND PERPETUALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT S/HE MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS EVENT, ANY DOCUMENT OR AGREEMENT ENTERED INTO IN CONNECTION HEREWITH, ANY PRIZE AVAILABLE IN CONNECTION HEREWITH, AND ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY.<br />\n<br />\n13. &nbsp; &nbsp;Privacy<br />\nPlease refer to Epic‚Äôs privacy policy located at https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/privacypolicy for important information regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personal information by Epic.<br />\n<br />\n¬© 2021 Epic Games, Inc.

Let‚Äôs dive right into it.</p>\n\n<h2>Arena Changes</h2>\n\n<p>As mentioned in our <a href=\"https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/competitive/news/fortnite-competitive-chapter-2-season-8-details\">Chapter 2 Season 8 Competitive blog</a>, we wanted to change Arena scoring to allow a more rewarding experience for players who reach Champion League. We‚Äôve made a few adjustments to Hype accumulation based on your current division. Eliminations are valued more at lower divisions and we‚Äôve increased the Bus Fare amount starting in Contender League to make crossing the threshold into Champion League slightly more difficult. An additional feature added to Arena this season: demotion. If the Bus Fare brings your Hype down a division, that will be the division you‚Äôre currently ranked in. To accommodate these changes, we‚Äôve made small adjustments to matchmaking.</p>\n\n<p>Lastly, we‚Äôve turned off Arena fill in standard Battle Royale Arena modes (Late Game will still fill). We appreciate everyone who decided to test it out. We are currently evaluating the changes of player behavior with data and going through your feedback before deciding whether Arena fill may return.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>Solo Arena

numerous benefits. Operationally our team caps off each season with FNCS Finals, and we need this time of little to no tournaments to prepare for the upcoming season‚Äôs competitive offerings and build out the schedule. Season 7 we held the All-Star Play-In during the Preseason and it was a large part of why we kept Preseason going, so Champion-level players could compete in the event.</p>\n\n<p>The Preseason also allows players to understand and experience the new items, features, and weapons that come with each season without large prized competitions.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, these two weeks allow us the opportunity to prove out items we believe would be problematic in competitive playlists and establish a competitive loot pool before the competitive season begins. You all can enjoy the new items and features for a brief period, with no stakes attached, and sometimes even show us innovative ways to use items that we hadn‚Äôt thought of previously. The only exception is our Performance Evaluation tests that run in the NAE region sometimes during the Preseason. These are necessary to gather better performance data for each patch and are only available in NAE due to specialized server restraints.</p>\n\n<h2>Competitive Surveys</h2>\n\n<p>We want to hear more from you! We‚Äôll be sending out a competitive focused survey to select players in the coming months. We‚Äôll be looking for your feedback on a wide range of competitive topics.</p>\n\n<p>If you‚Äôd like to participate, make sure you‚Äôve opted-in to receive emails from Epic Games products for your Epic Games account. You can opt-in on the <a href=\"http://www.epicgames.com/account/messaging\">Epic Games website</a> or go through the Epic Games Launcher by clicking your profile account and choosing Manage Account. This will take you straight to the website linked above. From there you‚Äôll need to click on Communications and check the box that says ‚ÄúYes, email me about Epic Games products, news, events and promotions.‚Äù</p>\n<img alt=\"Epic Games Notification Account Settings\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/epic-games-notification-account-settings-1220x617-1b6cd571f5f1.PNG\" style=\"height:auto; width:auto\" />\n<p>We plan to continue issuing surveys past next month, so make sure to stay opted-in past October if you‚Äôd like to receive more surveys from us.</p>\n\n<p>That covers everything for this update.

Let‚Äôs take a look at most of the changes we made to the mode.</p>\n\n<h2>New Late Game Solo Cup</h2>\n\n<p>We‚Äôre making Late Game Solo Mode available for the Solo Cup on October 1. The Solo mode includes eight new loadouts balanced for Solo play. Once you play in the Late Game Solo Cup, let us know your feedback.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2>Trios Fill Enabled and Loadout Updates</h2>\n\n<p>If you don‚Äôt have a full Trio - no sweat - Fill has been enabled! We‚Äôve also updated the original nine loadouts for the Trios mode to be more in line with the current season‚Äòs competitive loot pool.</p>\n\n<h2>So Much Hype</h2>\n\n<p>In the original Late Game we saw how much fun you had with Arena leaning towards a fast-paced brawl and Tournaments being more akin to standard competitive play. With that in mind we‚Äôve changed the Arena Divisions to have no bus fare and added long-term goals, especially for you grinders. We‚Äôll be experimenting with a variety of Tournament formats over the Season to provide a more serious environment that represents what you might see in an FNCS final. We‚Äôve also fixed the hype leaderboard!</p>\n\n<h2>Reboot Vans</h2>\n\n<p>Reboot Vans are now in by popular demand! Who doesn‚Äôt love a good reboot in the 5th zone?</p>\n\n<h2>Other Late Game Updates</h2>\n\n<p>Here are a few other items we addressed in Late Game:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">The first new zone forms 30 seconds faster. This will get you into that late game feeling that bit quicker. We may tweak this further depending on your feedback.</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">Loot on the starter island will now match the custom loadouts.</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">Alien Slipstreams are disabled at the start of the match.\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li aria-level=\"2\">You may see these look as though they are active, however, once close enough you‚Äôll see they are disabled.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">We had some issues with the storm not behaving properly in the original Late Game. This is fixed.</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">Occasionally matches wouldn‚Äôt fill with all 60 players. This is now fixed.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Along with the new loot, there‚Äôs a couple other pieces for you to discover. We‚Äôre eager to hear your feedback, whether it‚Äôs big clutches or improvements you‚Äôd like to see. Use #lategame on socials to help us see it!</p>\n\n<p>Check in-game for when your region‚Äôs Solo and Trio Cups start.

Epic reserves the right to cancel or suspend the Event in its sole discretion or due to circumstances beyond its control, including natural disasters. Epic may disqualify any player from participating in the Event or winning a prize if, in its sole discretion, it determines such player is attempting to undermine the legitimate operation of the Event by cheating, hacking, deception, or any other unfair playing practices intending to annoy, abuse, threaten, undermine, or harass any other players or Epic‚Äôs representatives. The internal laws of the State of North Carolina, without reference to any of its conflicts of laws principles, shall govern disputes regarding these Rules and/or the Event.

Additionally, players acknowledge that the different platforms may offer features, such as controllers, player interface, and/or ability to individualize certain game settings/sensitivities, etc., which may arguably provide a competitive advantage to one platform over another.

For clarity, a player‚Äôs receipt of coaching or use of the in-game replay tool does not fall within this prohibition.<br />\n<br />\nIntentionally disconnecting from the Game after you or a member of your team takes damage. For clarity, this only applies to players who intentionally disconnect with a member of their team receiving damage within 60 seconds prior to the intentional disconnection.<br />\n<br />\n8.2.2&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Players may not work together to deceive or otherwise cheat other players during any match (‚ÄúCollusion‚Äù).

By participating, each player agrees (or, if a Minor, such player‚Äôs parent or legal guardian agrees on such player‚Äôs behalf): (a) to be bound by these complete Rules (including the Code of Conduct) and the decisions of Epic which shall be final and binding; and (b) to waive any right to claim ambiguity in the Event or these Rules, except where prohibited by applicable law. By accepting a prize, the Winning Player agrees (or, if a Minor, such Winning Player‚Äôs parent or legal guardian agrees on such Winning Player‚Äôs behalf) to release Epic from any and all liability, loss, or damage arising from or in connection with awarding, receipt, and/or use or misuse of prize or participation in any prize-related activities.

Congratulations to all our FNCS Champions! Wield the Axe of Champions often this upcoming season.<br />\n<img alt=\"ALL REGION CHAMPS\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/all-region-champs-1920x1080-7d9118324fc0.png\" style=\"height:auto; width:auto\" /></p>\n\n<h2>Season 8 Arena Preseason</h2>\n\n<p>We‚Äôll be continuing the Arena Preseason in Season 8. We‚Äôll be monitoring new items and features and re-evaluating already existing items that may come back into the competitive loot pool. Arena Hype will carry over from Season 7 and will reset on September 28. To give players a chance to test out and play with the new seasonal changes in a meaningful way, we‚Äôre also adding a Preseason Warmup Test tournament, which will simulate a single FNCS qualifier weekend on September 24 - 26.</p>\n\n<h2>Season 8 FNCS Begins October 14</h2>\n\n<p>While we made very few changes to FNCS in Season 7, we‚Äôll be making several changes in Season 8. This FNCS season, there will only be two Qualifiers, followed by one week of competition including Semi-Finals and Finals. Let‚Äôs break it all down.<br />\n<em>Note: The dates for the Middle East Region will be one day earlier than what‚Äôs listed here.</em></p>\n\n<h3>Qualifiers (October 15-17 &amp; October 22-24)</h3>\n\n<p>We‚Äôve cut back on the number of Qualifiers and increased the number of teams that directly qualify for Finals. Now, the top 5 teams (previously top 3) from each Qualifier will skip the Semi-Finals and advance straight to the FNCS Finals.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>We feel this is a meaningful change as there is typically a clear points dropoff on the Leaderboards of each Qualifier after the top 5, and fewer Qualifiers allows the best teams that have directly qualified to the Finals to not miss out on pinnacle competition for a longer length of time. A shorter FNCS season is also necessary to accommodate for the additional end of year FNCS event and other competitive offerings.</p>\n\n<h3>Semi-Finals (October 28-29)</h3>\n\n<p>Semi-Finals will also work slightly differently this FNCS season. We took a close look at previous season‚Äôs Reboot Rounds and really enjoyed how they played out in regions that had the full 6 matches after disbands. Achieving a Victory Royale in any tournament match is a pinnacle Fortnite achievement. We‚Äôre excited to deliver more Victory Royale focused action this season!</p>\n\n<p>Now, we‚Äôll get a bit more sweaty as we only take the top 66 (previously top 99) teams in Series Points (2 Heats) in each region. Day 1 will consist of four matches in each Heat. The top 4 teams in each Heat after Day 1 will advance to the Finals. The remaining teams from each Heat will be seeded on their performance and reshuffled into new Heats for Day 2.</p>\n\n<p>Day 2 of Semi-Finals will essentially function in the same way as the Reboot Round from past seasons. There will be 6 games in each Heat (12 total games). The winners of each game will advance to the Finals.</p>\n\n<p>As the Semi-Finals progress across the two days with these changes, all participating teams are never out of the running! The map and contested POIs will dynamically open up as more and more teams advance out after each match, leading to a more natural crescendo for players and fans. Teams‚Äô in-the-moment early game decisions matter more during the duration of these new Semi-Finals.</p>\n\n<h3>Finals (October 30-31)</h3>\n\n<p>The FNCS Finals will remain the same as it has for the entire year with one caveat. Two days of competition with 6 games each day. The top performing team at the end of Day 2 will be crowned the FNCS Champion. However, unlike in past FNCS Finals, the top 3 teams from each region‚Äôs Finals will NOT receive automatic advancement to next season‚Äôs FNCS Finals. A new year means a fresh start for everyone.</p>\n\n<h3>Prize Pool</h3>\n\n<p>The prize pool will stay exactly the same as the Chapter 2 Season 7 FNCS prize pool. Here‚Äôs how the $3,000,000 shared prize pool is broken down per region.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Prize Pool per Region</strong></p>\n\n<div>\n<table cellspacing=\"0\">\n\t<colgroup>\n\t\t<col />\n\t\t<col />\n\t\t<col />\n\t\t<col />\n\t\t<col />\n\t\t<col />\n\t\t<col />\n\t</colgroup>\n\t<tbody>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t<p style=\"text-align:center\">EU</p>\n\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t<p style=\"text-align:center\">NAE</p>\n\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t<p style=\"text-align:center\">BR</p>\n\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t<p style=\"text-align:center\">NAW</p>\n\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t<p style=\"text-align:center\">ASIA</p>\n\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t<p style=\"text-align:center\">ME</p>\n\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t<p style=\"text-align:center\">OCE</p>\n\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t<p style=\"text-align:center\">$1,351,200</p>\n\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t<p style=\"text-align:center\">$635,100</p>\n\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t<p style=\"text-align:center\">$428,175</p>\n\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t<p style=\"text-align:center\">$222,300</p>\n\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t<p style=\"text-align:center\">$150,600</p>\n\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t<p style=\"text-align:center\">$122,250</p>\n\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t<p style=\"text-align:center\">$90,450</p>\n\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n\n<h2>FNCS Grand Royale Finale Event</h2>\n\n<p>Mark your calendars! The FNCS Grand Royale, with $5,000,000 on the line, will be held over the course of a two-week span starting on November 12. That‚Äôs just two weeks after the FNCS Season 8 Finals. Any eligible player who has made a single-lobby round of FNCS (Round 4 of an FNCS Qualifier, Semi-Finals, or Finals) this year may&nbsp; make a trio for the event. We‚Äôll have more information on the rules and format later in the season, so be on the lookout for that blog.</p>\n\n<h2>Arena Changes</h2>\n\n<p>We noticed the changes we made to the scoring system last season allowed players to get to Champion League even faster than before. With Champion League as the qualification metric to most of our competitive events, we want the achievement to hold more value. We‚Äôll be making more adjustments this season to make it more challenging to get to Champion League so quickly.</p>\n\n<p>We can‚Äôt point to a date just yet, but our intention is to explore a Fill option for Arena&nbsp; at a later point in Season 8. Once this test goes live we‚Äôll let you know.</p>\n\n<h2>Other Competitive Offerings</h2>\n\n<p>We‚Äôll continue our regular cadence of Cash Cups and LTM tournaments in Season 8. Trios Cash Cups and Trios Hype Cups on Mondays, new Duos Hype Cups on Fridays, and Solo Cash Cups on Sundays with LTM tournaments sprinkled around. DreamHack Cash Cup Extras are scheduled for October 6, November 3, and December 1. With our tight schedule for Season 8, the NAE and EU DreamHack Open Ft. Fortnite is scheduled for October 7-10. More information on that event will be made available on DreamHack‚Äôs <a href=\"https://dreamhack.com/fortnite/open/\">website</a> at a later date.</p>\n\n<h3>Console only events</h3>\n\n<p>Following the FNCS Finals, console players will have the opportunity to earn a share of the $250,000 prize pool in the Console Champions Cup on November 5-7. The Cup will run just like it has the past two seasons.</p>\n\n<p>In addition to the Console Champions Cup, we plan to hold console-specific tournaments where players can go head-to-head against each other on the same console machine. We‚Äôll share more details about our plans for those at a later date.</p>\n\n<h3>Other Offerings</h3>\n\n<p>There‚Äôs still more to come that we aren‚Äôt quite ready to talk about - including a new series of Outfit Cups. Expect a packed schedule this competitive season and we‚Äôll be sure to inform you of all the tournament offerings as more details are ready to be shared.</p>\n\n<p>Thank you for making this competitive year one of the best yet, and we look forward to seeing you compete in Chapter 2 Season 8!</p>\n","description":"Read what is new in Fortnite Competitive for Chapter 2 Season 8!

Epic reserves the right to seek damages and other remedies from such player to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nThe enforcement of any applicable punishment by Epic shall not provide such player with grounds for claims against Epic under any theory of law, or otherwise be considered a liability on the part of Epic to such player.<br />\n<br />\n9.2.3 &nbsp; &nbsp;If Epic decides that there have been repeated breaches of these Rules by a player, it may hand out increasing disciplinary action, up to and including permanent disqualification from all future competitive play of the Game. &nbsp;Epic may also enforce any applicable penalty specified in Epic‚Äôs Terms of Service and/or the Fortnite EULA.<br />\n<br />\n9.2.4 &nbsp; &nbsp;All Rules violations at the Event will be governed by the Epic Competitive Penalty Matrix. A final decision by Epic as to the appropriate disciplinary action will be final and binding on all players.<br />\n<br />\n9.3 &nbsp; &nbsp;Rule Disputes<br />\n<br />\nEpic has final, binding authority to decide all disputes with respect to any portion of these Rules, including the breach, enforcement, or interpretation thereof.<br />\n<br />\n10. &nbsp; &nbsp;Conditions<br />\n<br />\nThe Event is subject to these Rules.

By accepting a prize, the Winning Player agrees (or, if a Minor, such Winning Player‚Äôs parent or legal guardian agrees on such Winning Player‚Äôs behalf) to release Epic from any and all liability, loss, or damage arising from or in connection with awarding, receipt, and/or use or misuse of prize or participation in any prize-related activities.

Epic reserves the right to cancel or suspend the Event in its sole discretion or due to circumstances beyond its control, including natural disasters.

The internal laws of the State of North Carolina, without reference to any of its conflicts of laws principles, shall govern disputes regarding these Rules and/or the Event. Epic may, in its sole discretion, cancel, modify, or suspend the Event should a virus, bug, computer problem, unauthorized intervention, force majeure, or other cause beyond Epic‚Äôs control corrupt the administration, security, or proper play of the Event. Any attempt to deliberately damage or undermine the legitimate operation of the Event may be in violation of criminal and civil laws and will result in disqualification from participation in the Event. &nbsp;Should such an attempt be made, Epic reserves the right to seek remedies and damages (including attorneys‚Äô fees) to the fullest extent of the law, including criminal prosecution.

Except as otherwise determined by Epic in its sole discretion, any technical issues or Bug encounters, whether defined in this Section 5 or not, must be played through and will not be cause for a remake.<br />\n<br />\n5.2.2 &nbsp; &nbsp;Without limitation of the foregoing, players are prohibited from taking advantage of or otherwise exploiting any Bug that allows a player to participate in any Event round or stage without having first qualified for such round or stage pursuant to the terms of these Rules.<br />\n<br />\n5.2.3 &nbsp; &nbsp;In addition, players acknowledge and agree that in participating in a Game competitive event the individual player solely determines which platform to use (i.e., PC, console, or mobile (as applicable)) and understands that he/she may face players competing on a different platform. Additionally, players acknowledge that the different platforms may offer features, such as controllers, player interface, and/or ability to individualize certain game settings/sensitivities, etc., which may arguably provide a competitive advantage to one platform over another. Players acknowledge their sole competitive platform choice and agree and waive any responsibility or liability of Epic relating to such player‚Äôs involvement in a multiplatform competition, including any alleged competitive advantage of any other platform.<br />\n<br />\n6. &nbsp; &nbsp;Communication<br />\n<br />\n6.1 &nbsp; &nbsp;Event Administrators will be available to answer player-specific questions and provide additional assistance throughout the Event via the official player support channel found here: https://epicgames.helpshift.com/a/fortnite/?contact=1&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n7. &nbsp; &nbsp;Post-Match Process<br />\n<br />\n7.1 &nbsp; &nbsp;Scoring<br />\n<br />\n7.1.1 &nbsp; &nbsp;The Game client will record and report a player‚Äôs score at the conclusion of such player‚Äôs participation in a match.<br />\n<br />\n7.1.2 &nbsp; &nbsp;At times, unforeseen issues may arise that result in score reporting delays and/or inaccuracies.

In particular, players shall not engage in harassing or disrespectful conduct, use of abusive or offensive language, game sabotage, spamming, social engineering, scamming, or any unlawful activity (‚ÄúToxic Behavior‚Äù).<br />\n<br />\n8.1.4 &nbsp; &nbsp;Players shall not (a) proclaim to be, or represent themselves as, a banned player or a cheater/rule breaker, or (b) glorify or otherwise endorse the breaking or violation of these Rules.<br />\n<br />\n8.1.5 &nbsp; &nbsp;Any violation of these Rules may expose a player to disciplinary action as further described in Section 9.2, whether or not that violation was committed intentionally.<br />\n<br />\n8.2 &nbsp; &nbsp;Competitive Integrity<br />\n<br />\n8.2.1 &nbsp; &nbsp;Each player is expected to play within the spirit of the Game and these Rules at all times during any Event match. &nbsp;Any form of unfair play is prohibited by these Rules, and may result in disciplinary action. &nbsp;Examples of unfair play include the following:<br />\n<br />\nCollusion (as defined below), match fixing or throwing, bribing a referee or match official, or any other unfair or illegal action or agreement to intentionally influence (or attempt to influence) the outcome of any match or Event.<br />\n<br />\nHacking or otherwise modifying the intended behavior of the Game client.<br />\n<br />\nPlaying or allowing another player to play on an Epic account registered in another person‚Äôs name (or soliciting, encouraging, or directing someone else to do so).<br />\n<br />\nUsing any kind of cheating device, program, or similar cheating method to gain a competitive advantage.<br />\n<br />\nIntentionally exploiting any game function (e.g., an in-game bug or glitch) in a manner not intended by Epic in order to gain a competitive advantage.<br />\n<br />\nUsing distributed denial of service attacks, swatting, or similar methods to interfere with another player‚Äôs connection to the Game‚Äôs game client.<br />\n<br />\nUsing macro keys or similar methods to automate in-game actions.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nAccepting any gift, reward, bribe, or compensation for services promised, rendered, or to be rendered in connection with unfair play of the Game (e.g., services designed to throw or fix a match or session).<br />\n<br />\nUtilizing outside assistance regarding the location of other players, other players‚Äô health or equipment, or any other information not otherwise known to the player by the information on his or her own screen (e.g., looking at or attempting to look at spectator monitors while currently in a match). For clarity, a player‚Äôs receipt of coaching or use of the in-game replay tool does not fall within this prohibition.<br />\n<br />\n8.2.2 &nbsp; &nbsp;Players may not work together to deceive or otherwise cheat other players during any match (‚ÄúCollusion‚Äù). Examples of Collusion include the following:<br />\n<br />\nTeaming: Players working together during the match while on opposing teams.<br />\n<br />\nPlanned Movement: Agreement between 2 or more opposing players to land at specific locations or to move through the map in a planned way before the match begins.<br />\n<br />\nCommunication: Sending or receiving signals (both verbal and non-verbal) to communicate with opposing players.<br />\n<br />\nItem Dumping: Intentionally dropping items for an opposing player to collect.<br />\n<br />\nFeeding: Intentionally allowing oneself to be eliminated by an opposing player.<br />\n<br />\n8.3 &nbsp; &nbsp;Wagering&nbsp;<br />\nPlayers shall not (a) conduct or promote betting, wagering, or gambling on the Event or any portion thereof, or (b) benefit, either directly or indirectly, from betting, wagering, or gambling on the Event or any portion thereof.<br />\n8.4 &nbsp; &nbsp;Harassment<br />\n<br />\n8.4.1 &nbsp; &nbsp;Players are prohibited from engaging in any form of harassing, abusive, or discriminatory conduct based on race, color, ethnicity, national origin, religion, political opinion or any other opinion, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, age, disability, or any other status or characteristic protected under applicable law.<br />\n<br />\n8.4.2 &nbsp; &nbsp;Any player who witnesses or is subjected to harassing, abusive, or discriminatory conduct should notify an Epic Esports Coordinator or Event Administrator.

If Epic and/or an Event Administrator contacts a player to discuss the investigation, the player must be truthful in the information that he or she provides to Epic and/or an Event Administrator. Any player found to have withheld, destroyed, or tampered with any related information, or otherwise found to have misled Epic and/or an Event Administrator during an investigation, will be subject to disciplinary action as further described in Section 9.2.<br />\n<br />\n9.2 &nbsp; &nbsp;Disciplinary Action<br />\n<br />\n9.2.1 &nbsp; &nbsp;If Epic decides that a player has violated the Code, Epic may take the following disciplinary actions (as applicable):<br />\n<br />\nIssue a private or public warning (verbal or written) to the player;<br />\n<br />\nLoss of session points for the current or future match(es);<br />\n<br />\nLoss of all or any part of the prizes previously awarded to the player;<br />\n<br />\nDisqualify the player from participating in one or more matches and/or sessions at the Event; or<br />\n<br />\nPrevent the player from participating in one or more future competitions hosted by Epic.<br />\n<br />\n9.2.2 &nbsp; &nbsp;For clarity, the nature and extent of the disciplinary action taken by Epic pursuant to this Section 9.2 will be in the sole and absolute discretion of Epic. Epic reserves the right to seek damages and other remedies from such player to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nThe enforcement of any applicable punishment by Epic shall not provide such player with grounds for claims against Epic under any theory of law, or otherwise be considered a liability on the part of Epic to such player.<br />\n<br />\n9.2.3 &nbsp; &nbsp;If Epic decides that there have been repeated breaches of these Rules by a player, it may hand out increasing disciplinary action, up to and including permanent disqualification from all future competitive play of the Game. &nbsp;Epic may also enforce any applicable penalty specified in Epic‚Äôs Terms of Service and/or the Fortnite EULA.<br />\n<br />\n9.2.4 &nbsp; &nbsp;All Rules violations at the Event will be governed by the Epic Competitive Penalty Matrix. A final decision by Epic as to the appropriate disciplinary action will be final and binding on all players.<br />\n<br />\n9.3 &nbsp; &nbsp;Rule Disputes<br />\n<br />\nEpic has final, binding authority to decide all disputes with respect to any portion of these Rules, including the breach, enforcement, or interpretation thereof.<br />\n<br />\n10. &nbsp; &nbsp;Conditions<br />\n<br />\nThe Event is subject to these Rules. By participating, each player agrees (or, if a Minor, such player‚Äôs parent or legal guardian agrees on such player‚Äôs behalf): (a) to be bound by these complete Rules (including the Code of Conduct) and the decisions of Epic which shall be final and binding; and (b) to waive any right to claim ambiguity in the Event or these Rules, except where prohibited by applicable law. By accepting a prize, the Winning Player agrees (or, if a Minor, such Winning Player‚Äôs parent or legal guardian agrees on such Winning Player‚Äôs behalf) to release Epic from any and all liability, loss, or damage arising from or in connection with awarding, receipt, and/or use or misuse of prize or participation in any prize-related activities.

In particular, players shall not engage in harassing or disrespectful conduct, use of abusive or offensive language, game sabotage, spamming, social engineering, scamming, or any unlawful activity (‚ÄúToxic Behavior‚Äù).<br />\n<br />\n8.1.4&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Players shall not (a) proclaim to be, or represent themselves as, a banned player or a cheater/rule breaker, or (b) glorify or otherwise endorse the breaking or violation of these Rules.<br />\n<br />\n8.1.5&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Any violation of these Rules may expose a player to disciplinary action as further described in Section 9.2, whether or not that violation was committed intentionally.<br />\n<br />\n8.2&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Competitive Integrity<br />\n<br />\n8.2.1&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Each player is expected to play within the spirit of the Game and these Rules at all times during any Event match. &nbsp;Any form of unfair play is prohibited by these Rules, and may result in disciplinary action. &nbsp;Examples of unfair play include the following:<br />\n<br />\nCollusion (as defined below), match fixing or throwing, bribing a referee or match official, or any other unfair or illegal action or agreement to intentionally influence (or attempt to influence) the outcome of any match or Event.<br />\n<br />\nHacking or otherwise modifying the intended behavior of the Game client.<br />\n<br />\nPlaying or allowing another player to play on an Epic account registered in another person‚Äôs name (or soliciting, encouraging, or directing someone else to do so).<br />\n<br />\nUsing any kind of cheating device, program, or similar cheating method to gain a competitive advantage.<br />\n<br />\nIntentionally exploiting any game function (e.g., an in-game bug or glitch) in a manner not intended by Epic in order to gain a competitive advantage.<br />\n<br />\nUsing distributed denial of service attacks, swatting, or similar methods to interfere with another player‚Äôs connection to the Game‚Äôs game client.<br />\n<br />\nUsing macro keys or similar methods to automate in-game actions.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nAccepting any gift, reward, bribe, or compensation for services promised, rendered, or to be rendered in connection with unfair play of the Game (e.g., services designed to throw or fix a match or session).<br />\n<br />\nUtilizing outside assistance regarding the location of other players, other players‚Äô health or equipment, or any other information not otherwise known to the player by the information on his or her own screen (e.g., looking at or attempting to look at spectator monitors while currently in a match). For clarity, a player‚Äôs receipt of coaching or use of the in-game replay tool does not fall within this prohibition.<br />\n<br />\n8.2.2&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Players may not work together to deceive or otherwise cheat other players during any match (‚ÄúCollusion‚Äù). Examples of Collusion include the following:<br />\n<br />\nTeaming: Players working together during the match while on opposing teams.<br />\n<br />\nPlanned Movement: Agreement between 2 or more opposing players to land at specific locations or to move through the map in a planned way before the match begins.<br />\n<br />\nCommunication: Sending or receiving signals (both verbal and non-verbal) to communicate with opposing players.<br />\n<br />\nItem Dumping: Intentionally dropping items for an opposing player to collect.<br />\n<br />\nFeeding: Intentionally allowing oneself to be eliminated by an opposing player.<br />\n<br />\n8.3&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Wagering&nbsp;<br />\nPlayers shall not (a) conduct or promote betting, wagering, or gambling on the Event or any portion thereof, or (b) benefit, either directly or indirectly, from betting, wagering, or gambling on the Event or any portion thereof.<br />\n8.4&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Harassment<br />\n<br />\n8.4.1&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Players are prohibited from engaging in any form of harassing, abusive, or discriminatory conduct based on race, color, ethnicity, national origin, religion, political opinion or any other opinion, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, age, disability, or any other status or characteristic protected under applicable law.<br />\n<br />\n8.4.2&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Any player who witnesses or is subjected to harassing, abusive, or discriminatory conduct should notify an Epic Esports Coordinator or Event Administrator. All complaints reported pursuant to this Section 8.4.2 will be promptly investigated and appropriate action will be taken. Retaliation against any player who brings forward a complaint or cooperates in the investigation of a complaint is prohibited.<br />\n<br />\n8.5&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Confidentiality<br />\n<br />\nA player may not disclose to any third party any confidential information provided by the Event Administrators, Epic, or its affiliates concerning the Game, the Event, Epic, or its affiliates, by any method of communication, including by posting on social media channels.<br />\n<br />\n8.6&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Illegal Conduct<br />\n<br />\nPlayers are required to comply with all applicable laws at all times.<br />\n<br />\n9.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Rules and Conduct Violations<br />\n<br />\n9.1&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Investigation and Compliance<br />\n<br />\nPlayers agree to fully cooperate with Epic and/or an Event Administrator (as applicable) in the investigation of any violation of these Rules. If Epic and/or an Event Administrator contacts a player to discuss the investigation, the player must be truthful in the information that he or she provides to Epic and/or an Event Administrator. Any player found to have withheld, destroyed, or tampered with any related information, or otherwise found to have misled Epic and/or an Event Administrator during an investigation, will be subject to disciplinary action as further described in Section 9.2.<br />\n<br />\n9.2&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Disciplinary Action<br />\n<br />\n9.2.1&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;If Epic decides that a player has violated the Code, Epic may take the following disciplinary actions (as applicable):<br />\n<br />\nIssue a private or public warning (verbal or written) to the player;<br />\n<br />\nLoss of session points for the current or future match(es);<br />\n<br />\nLoss of all or any part of the prizes previously awarded to the player;<br />\n<br />\nDisqualify the player from participating in one or more matches and/or sessions at the Event; or<br />\n<br />\nPrevent the player from participating in one or more future competitions hosted by Epic.<br />\n<br />\n9.2.2&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;For clarity, the nature and extent of the disciplinary action taken by Epic pursuant to this Section 9.2 will be in the sole and absolute discretion of Epic. Epic reserves the right to seek damages and other remedies from such player to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nThe enforcement of any applicable punishment by Epic shall not provide such player with grounds for claims against Epic under any theory of law, or otherwise be considered a liability on the part of Epic to such player.<br />\n<br />\n9.2.3&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;If Epic decides that there have been repeated breaches of these Rules by a player, it may hand out increasing disciplinary action, up to and including permanent disqualification from all future competitive play of the Game. &nbsp;Epic may also enforce any applicable penalty specified in Epic‚Äôs Terms of Service and/or the Fortnite EULA.<br />\n<br />\n9.2.4&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;All Rules violations at the Event will be governed by the Epic Competitive Penalty Matrix. A final decision by Epic as to the appropriate disciplinary action will be final and binding on all players.<br />\n<br />\n9.3&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Rule Disputes<br />\n<br />\nEpic has final, binding authority to decide all disputes with respect to any portion of these Rules, including the breach, enforcement, or interpretation thereof.<br />\n<br />\n10.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Conditions<br />\n<br />\nThe Event is subject to these Rules. By participating, each player agrees (or, if a Minor, such player‚Äôs parent or legal guardian agrees on such player‚Äôs behalf): (a) to be bound by these complete Rules (including the Code of Conduct) and the decisions of Epic which shall be final and binding; and (b) to waive any right to claim ambiguity in the Event or these Rules, except where prohibited by applicable law. By accepting a prize, the Winning Player agrees (or, if a Minor, such Winning Player‚Äôs parent or legal guardian agrees on such Winning Player‚Äôs behalf) to release Epic from any and all liability, loss, or damage arising from or in connection with awarding, receipt, and/or use or misuse of prize or participation in any prize-related activities. Epic shall not be liable for: (i) telephone system, telephone, or computer hardware, software, or other technical or computer malfunctions, lost connections, disconnections, delays, or transmission errors; (ii) data corruption, theft, destruction, and unauthorized access to or alteration of entry or other materials; (iii) any injuries, losses, or damages of any kind, including death caused by the prize or resulting from acceptance, possession, or use of a prize, or from participation in the Event; or (iv) any printing, typographical, administrative, or technological errors in any materials associated with the Event. Epic reserves the right to cancel or suspend the Event in its sole discretion or due to circumstances beyond its control, including natural disasters. Epic may disqualify any player from participating in the Event or winning a prize if, in its sole discretion, it determines such player is attempting to undermine the legitimate operation of the Event by cheating, hacking, deception, or any other unfair playing practices intending to annoy, abuse, threaten, undermine, or harass any other players or Epic‚Äôs representatives. The internal laws of the State of North Carolina, without reference to any of its conflicts of laws principles, shall govern disputes regarding these Rules and/or the Event. Epic may, in its sole discretion, cancel, modify, or suspend the Event should a virus, bug, computer problem, unauthorized intervention, force majeure, or other cause beyond Epic‚Äôs control corrupt the administration, security, or proper play of the Event. Any attempt to deliberately damage or undermine the legitimate operation of the Event may be in violation of criminal and civil laws and will result in disqualification from participation in the Event. &nbsp;Should such an attempt be made, Epic reserves the right to seek remedies and damages (including attorneys‚Äô fees) to the fullest extent of the law, including criminal prosecution. The Event is subject to all applicable federal, state, and local laws.<br />\n<br />\n11.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Publicity<br />\n<br />\nEpic reserves the right to use the name, tag, likeness, audio, video, game play statistics, and/or Epic account ID of any player, for publicity purposes prior to, during, or after the Event end date, in any media, throughout the world, in perpetuity, but only in connection with publicizing the Event or other Game events and programing, without any compensation or prior review unless specifically prohibited by law.<br />\n<br />\n12.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Waiver of Jury Trial<br />\n<br />\nExcept as prohibited by applicable law and as a condition of participating in this Event, each Participant hereby irrevocably and perpetually waives any right s/he may have to a trial by jury in respect of any litigation directly or indirectly arising out of, under or in connection with this Event, any document or agreement entered into in connection herewith, any prize available in connection herewith, and any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.<br />\n<br />\n13.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Privacy<br />\nPlease refer to Epic‚Äôs privacy policy located at https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/privacypolicy for important information regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personal information by Epic.<br />\n<br />\n¬© 2021 Epic Games, Inc.

Winning Players are responsible for any costs and expenses associated with prize acceptance and use not specified herein as being provided. Winning Players may not substitute a prize, but Epic reserves the right, at its sole discretion, in case of justified reasons, to substitute a prize (or portion thereof) with one of comparable or greater value.

If a player qualifies to Stage 2 multiple times with different teams through the Series Points advancement as listed in Section 2.5.9, the team with the higher Series Points value will be the qualified team and the team with the lower Series Points value will not be valid. In order to make the lower qualification valid, all three (3) players on the Stage 2 qualified team must submit a written request to disband by filling out the team disband form: https://disband.questionpro.com before the deadline of 6:00 PM ET on August 23, 2021. If such request is approved, the existing Stage 2 qualified team will be removed from the furthest stage previously achieved, and the next in-line team(s) will advance to Stage 2 based on the Series Points Leaderboard.&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\n4.2.4 &nbsp; &nbsp;All members of a team that fall within the prizing thresholds set forth in Section 2.6.1 must successfully pass the verification of eligibility process described in Section 2.6.2 in order to be eligible to receive such prizes.

Except as otherwise expressly set forth herein, all of the Event Administrators‚Äô rights pursuant to these Rules relate to and are exercisable against the team as a whole and each individual member of the team. If any right of disqualification arises as to any individual member of the team, then the right of disqualification may be exercised against the team as a whole, as the Event Administrators may elect in their sole discretion.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n4.2.6 &nbsp; &nbsp;Earned Qualifier, Semi-Finals, Reboot Round, or Finals qualification spots (as applicable) cannot be transferred, sold, traded, or gifted to any person or organization.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n5. &nbsp; &nbsp;Issues<br />\n<br />\n5.1 &nbsp; &nbsp;Definition of Terms<br />\n<br />\n5.1.1 &nbsp; &nbsp;Bug&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nAn error, flaw, failure, or fault that produces an incorrect or unexpected result, or otherwise causes the Game and/or a hardware device to behave in unintended ways.<br />\n<br />\n5.1.2 &nbsp; &nbsp;Intentional Disconnection&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nA player losing connection to the Game due to the player‚Äôs actions.

Except as otherwise determined by Epic in its sole discretion, any technical issues or Bug encounters, whether defined in this Section 5 or not, must be played through and will not be cause for a remake.<br />\n<br />\n5.2.2 &nbsp; &nbsp;Without limitation of the foregoing, players are prohibited from taking advantage of or otherwise exploiting any Bug that allows a player to participate in any Event round or stage without having first qualified for such round or stage pursuant to the terms of these Rules.<br />\n<br />\n5.2.3 &nbsp; &nbsp;In addition, players acknowledge and agree that in participating in a Game competitive event the individual player solely determines which platform to use (i.e., PC, console, or mobile (as applicable)) and understands that he/she may face players competing on a different platform. Additionally, players acknowledge that the different platforms may offer features, such as controllers, player interface, and/or ability to individualize certain game settings/sensitivities, etc., which may arguably provide a competitive advantage to one platform over another. Players acknowledge their sole competitive platform choice and agree and waive any responsibility or liability of Epic relating to such player‚Äôs involvement in a multiplatform competition, including any alleged competitive advantage of any other platform.<br />\n<br />\n6. &nbsp; &nbsp;Communication<br />\n<br />\n6.1 &nbsp; &nbsp;Event Administrators will be available to answer player-specific questions and provide additional assistance throughout the Event via the official player support channel found here: https://epicgames.helpshift.com/a/fortnite/?contact=1&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n7. &nbsp; &nbsp;Post-Match Process<br />\n<br />\n7.1 &nbsp; &nbsp;Scoring<br />\n<br />\n7.1.1 &nbsp; &nbsp;The Game client will record and report a player‚Äôs score at the conclusion of such player‚Äôs participation in a match.<br />\n<br />\n7.1.2 &nbsp; &nbsp;At times, unforeseen issues may arise that result in score reporting delays and/or inaccuracies.

In particular, players shall not engage in harassing or disrespectful conduct, use of abusive or offensive language, game sabotage, spamming, social engineering, scamming, or any unlawful activity (‚ÄúToxic Behavior‚Äù).<br />\n<br />\n8.1.4 &nbsp; &nbsp;Players shall not (a) proclaim to be, or represent themselves as, a banned player or a cheater/rule breaker, or (b) glorify or otherwise endorse the breaking or violation of these Rules.<br />\n<br />\n8.1.5 &nbsp; &nbsp;Any violation of these Rules may expose a player to disciplinary action as further described in Section 9.2, whether or not that violation was committed intentionally.<br />\n<br />\n8.2 &nbsp; &nbsp;Competitive Integrity<br />\n<br />\n8.2.1 &nbsp; &nbsp;Each player is expected to play within the spirit of the Game and these Rules at all times during any Event match. &nbsp;Any form of unfair play is prohibited by these Rules, and may result in disciplinary action. &nbsp;Examples of unfair play include the following:<br />\n<br />\nCollusion (as defined below), match fixing or throwing, bribing a referee or match official, or any other unfair or illegal action or agreement to intentionally influence (or attempt to influence) the outcome of any match or Event.<br />\n<br />\nHacking or otherwise modifying the intended behavior of the Game client.<br />\n<br />\nPlaying or allowing another player to play on an Epic account registered in another person‚Äôs name (or soliciting, encouraging, or directing someone else to do so).<br />\n<br />\nUsing any kind of cheating device, program, or similar cheating method to gain a competitive advantage.<br />\n<br />\nIntentionally exploiting any game function (e.g., an in-game bug or glitch) in a manner not intended by Epic in order to gain a competitive advantage.<br />\n<br />\nUsing distributed denial of service attacks, swatting, or similar methods to interfere with another player‚Äôs connection to the Game‚Äôs game client.<br />\n<br />\nUsing macro keys or similar methods to automate in-game actions.<br />\n<br />\nAccepting or requesting any gift, reward, bribe, or compensation for services promised, rendered, or to be rendered in connection with unfair play of the Game (e.g., services designed to throw or fix a match or session).<br />\n<br />\nUtilizing outside assistance regarding the location of other players, other players‚Äô health or equipment, or any other information not otherwise known to the player by the information on his or her own screen (e.g., looking at or attempting to look at spectator monitors while currently in a match). For clarity, a player‚Äôs receipt of coaching or use of the in-game replay tool does not fall within this prohibition.<br />\n<br />\nIntentionally disconnecting from the Game after you or a member of your team takes damage. For clarity, this only applies to players who intentionally disconnect with a member of their team receiving damage within 60 seconds prior to the intentional disconnection.<br />\n<br />\n8.2.2 &nbsp; &nbsp;Players may not work together to deceive or otherwise cheat other players during any match (‚ÄúCollusion‚Äù).

Prizes are not transferable or assignable and cannot be transferred by Winning Players. Non-cash prizes (if any) cannot be redeemed for cash. All prize details are at the sole discretion of Epic. Winning Players are not entitled to any surplus between actual retail value of prize and approximate retail value and any difference between approximate and actual value of the prize will not be awarded. Winning Players are responsible for any costs and expenses associated with prize acceptance and use not specified herein as being provided. Winning Players may not substitute a prize, but Epic reserves the right, at its sole discretion, in case of justified reasons, to substitute a prize (or portion thereof) with one of comparable or greater value. Additional terms and conditions may apply to acceptance and use of a prize.<br />\n<br />\nThe highest scoring players will be notified by Epic of their status as a potential Winning Player at the email address associated with such players‚Äô Epic account within 30 days of completion of the Event, or such other time as reasonably required by Epic for such notification, and will be subject to verification of eligibility pursuant to Section 3 and compliance with these Rules. &nbsp;A potential Winning Player must keep the Epic account that he or she used to compete in the Event active throughout the verification of eligibility process.<br />\n<br />\nUpon formal notification from Epic, a potential Winning Player shall have 45 days from the date such notice was emailed to respond and provide any information or materials requested by Epic, including the Release (as defined below) for purposes of verification of eligibility pursuant to Section 3. &nbsp;Such response from a potential Winning Player must be delivered to the email address from which Epic‚Äôs notification was sent or, at Epic‚Äôs sole option, another email address specified in the notification. &nbsp;The date of receipt by Epic shall be decisive for a potential Winning Player‚Äôs compliance with the deadlines set forth in this Section 2.5.2.<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nIn the event of (a) the failure by any such player to (i) keep the Epic account that he or she used to compete in the Event active throughout the verification of eligibility process or (ii) timely respond to any notification or request for materials or information; or (b) any such player being unable to accept or receive the prize for any reason (including, without limitation, for failure to provide the necessary tax and payment information through Epic‚Äôs approved tax and payment processing vendors), then in either case (items (a) or (b)), such player shall be disqualified as a potential Winning Player, and such player shall not be entitled to win any prizes in connection with the Event. &nbsp;In such cases, no alternate Winning Player will be named, and Epic shall have the right, in its sole and absolute discretion, to (y) award any prize amounts that would have otherwise been awarded to such disqualified player as part of a future Game competitive event or (z) award any such prize amounts to non-profit causes and efforts. &nbsp;A Winning Player will only be announced once the verification of eligibility process has been completed by Epic pursuant to these Rules.<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nWinning Players will also be required to provide certain payment information to Epic, including any required tax information forms, in order to receive the prizes.

Except as otherwise expressly set forth herein, all of the Event Administrators‚Äô rights pursuant to these Rules relate to and are exercisable against the team as a whole and each individual member of the team. If any right of disqualification arises as to any individual member of the team, then the right of disqualification may be exercised against the team as a whole, as the Event Administrators may elect in their sole discretion.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n4.1.5 &nbsp; &nbsp;Players may only party up with those within the same platform grouping. For clarity, this means that PC players may only queue together with other PC players, and console players may only queue together with other console players.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n4.1.6&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Earned Round 2, Stage 2, or Grand Finals qualification spots (as applicable) cannot be transferred, sold, traded, or gifted to any person or organization.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n5. &nbsp; &nbsp;Issues<br />\n<br />\n5.1 &nbsp; &nbsp;Definition of Terms<br />\n<br />\n5.1.1 &nbsp; &nbsp;Bug&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nAn error, flaw, failure, or fault that produces an incorrect or unexpected result, or otherwise causes the Game and/or a hardware device to behave in unintended ways.<br />\n<br />\n5.1.2 &nbsp; &nbsp;Intentional Disconnection&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nA player losing connection to the Game due to the player‚Äôs actions.

Except as otherwise determined by Epic in its sole discretion, any technical issues or Bug encounters, whether defined in this Section 5 or not, must be played through and will not be cause for a remake.<br />\n<br />\n5.2.2 &nbsp; &nbsp;Without limitation of the foregoing, players are prohibited from taking advantage of or otherwise exploiting any Bug that allows a player to participate in any Event round or stage without having first qualified for such round or stage pursuant to the terms of these Rules.<br />\n<br />\n5.2.3 &nbsp; &nbsp;In addition, players acknowledge and agree that in participating in a Game competitive event the individual player solely determines which platform to use (i.e., PC, console, or mobile (as applicable)) and understands that he/she may face players competing on a different platform. Additionally, players acknowledge that the different platforms may offer features, such as controllers, player interface, and/or ability to individualize certain game settings/sensitivities, etc., which may arguably provide a competitive advantage to one platform over another. Players acknowledge their sole competitive platform choice and agree and waive any responsibility or liability of Epic relating to such player‚Äôs involvement in a multiplatform competition, including any alleged competitive advantage of any other platform.<br />\n<br />\n6. &nbsp; &nbsp;Communication<br />\n<br />\n6.1 &nbsp; &nbsp;Event Administrators will be available to answer player-specific questions and provide additional assistance throughout the Event via the official player support channel found here: https://epicgames.helpshift.com/a/fortnite/?contact=1&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n7. &nbsp; &nbsp;Post-Match Process<br />\n<br />\n7.1 &nbsp; &nbsp;Scoring<br />\n<br />\n7.1.1 &nbsp; &nbsp;The Game client will record and report a player‚Äôs score at the conclusion of such player‚Äôs participation in a match.<br />\n<br />\n7.1.2 &nbsp; &nbsp;At times, unforeseen issues may arise that result in score reporting delays and/or inaccuracies.

Examples of Collusion include the following:<br />\n<br />\nTeaming: Players working together during the match while on opposing teams.<br />\n<br />\nPlanned Movement: Agreement between 2 or more opposing players to land at specific locations or to move through the map in a planned way before the match begins.<br />\n<br />\nCommunication: Sending or receiving signals (both verbal and non-verbal) to communicate with opposing players.<br />\n<br />\nItem Dumping: Intentionally dropping items for an opposing player to collect.<br />\n<br />\nFeeding: Intentionally allowing oneself to be eliminated by an opposing player.<br />\n<br />\n8.3 &nbsp; &nbsp;Wagering&nbsp;<br />\nPlayers shall not (a) conduct or promote betting, wagering, or gambling on the Event or any portion thereof, or (b) benefit, either directly or indirectly, from betting, wagering, or gambling on the Event or any portion thereof.<br />\n8.4 &nbsp; &nbsp;Harassment<br />\n<br />\n8.4.1 &nbsp; &nbsp;Players are prohibited from engaging in any form of harassing, abusive, or discriminatory conduct based on race, color, ethnicity, national origin, religion, political opinion or any other opinion, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, age, disability, or any other status or characteristic protected under applicable law.<br />\n<br />\n8.4.2 &nbsp; &nbsp;Any player who witnesses or is subjected to harassing, abusive, or discriminatory conduct should notify an Epic Esports Coordinator or Event Administrator.

If Epic and/or an Event Administrator contacts a player to discuss the investigation, the player must be truthful in the information that he or she provides to Epic and/or an Event Administrator. Any player found to have withheld, destroyed, or tampered with any related information, or otherwise found to have misled Epic and/or an Event Administrator during an investigation, will be subject to disciplinary action as further described in Section 9.2.<br />\n<br />\n9.2 &nbsp; &nbsp;Disciplinary Action<br />\n<br />\n9.2.1 &nbsp; &nbsp;If Epic decides that a player has violated the Code, Epic may take the following disciplinary actions (as applicable):<br />\n<br />\nIssue a private or public warning (verbal or written) to the player;<br />\n<br />\nLoss of session points for the current or future match(es);<br />\n<br />\nLoss of all or any part of the prizes previously awarded to the player;<br />\n<br />\nDisqualify the player from participating in one or more matches and/or sessions at the Event; or<br />\n<br />\nPrevent the player from participating in one or more future competitions hosted by Epic.<br />\n<br />\n9.2.2 &nbsp; &nbsp;For clarity, the nature and extent of the disciplinary action taken by Epic pursuant to this Section 9.2 will be in the sole and absolute discretion of Epic. Epic reserves the right to seek damages and other remedies from such player to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nThe enforcement of any applicable punishment by Epic shall not provide such player with grounds for claims against Epic under any theory of law, or otherwise be considered a liability on the part of Epic to such player.<br />\n<br />\n9.2.3 &nbsp; &nbsp;If Epic decides that there have been repeated breaches of these Rules by a player, it may hand out increasing disciplinary action, up to and including permanent disqualification from all future competitive play of the Game. &nbsp;Epic may also enforce any applicable penalty specified in Epic‚Äôs Terms of Service and/or the Fortnite EULA.<br />\n<br />\n9.2.4 &nbsp; &nbsp;All Rules violations at the Event will be governed by the Epic Competitive Penalty Matrix. A final decision by Epic as to the appropriate disciplinary action will be final and binding on all players.<br />\n<br />\n9.3 &nbsp; &nbsp;Rule Disputes<br />\n<br />\nEpic has final, binding authority to decide all disputes with respect to any portion of these Rules, including the breach, enforcement, or interpretation thereof.<br />\n<br />\n10. &nbsp; &nbsp;Conditions<br />\n<br />\nThe Event is subject to these Rules.

By accepting a prize, the Winning Player agrees (or, if a Minor, such Winning Player‚Äôs parent or legal guardian agrees on such Winning Player‚Äôs behalf) to release Epic from any and all liability, loss, or damage arising from or in connection with awarding, receipt, and/or use or misuse of prize or participation in any prize-related activities. Epic shall not be liable for: (i) telephone system, telephone, or computer hardware, software, or other technical or computer malfunctions, lost connections, disconnections, delays, or transmission errors; (ii) data corruption, theft, destruction, and unauthorized access to or alteration of entry or other materials; (iii) any injuries, losses, or damages of any kind, including death caused by the prize or resulting from acceptance, possession, or use of a prize, or from participation in the Event; or (iv) any printing, typographical, administrative, or technological errors in any materials associated with the Event. Epic reserves the right to cancel or suspend the Event in its sole discretion or due to circumstances beyond its control, including natural disasters.

The internal laws of the State of North Carolina, without reference to any of its conflicts of laws principles, shall govern disputes regarding these Rules and/or the Event. Epic may, in its sole discretion, cancel, modify, or suspend the Event should a virus, bug, computer problem, unauthorized intervention, force majeure, or other cause beyond Epic‚Äôs control corrupt the administration, security, or proper play of the Event.

For clarity, an Event Administrator must be present in each High Tier match. In cases where connection issues are present during a match, impacted players must inform the Event Administrators as soon as such players become aware of such connection issues. Upon notification of connection issues, the Event Administrators will determine, in their sole discretion, whether or not such match will be restarted or played through pursuant to Section 5.2.1. Without limitation of the foregoing, Event Administrators reserve the right to suspend and invalidate a High Tier match for a re-host at any time.<br />\n<br />\n2.8.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Participation Eligibility<br />\n<br />\nEligibility for participation in High Tier will be determined by one of two (2) separate entry methods as follows:&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n1) Direct nomination by a player on an FNCS Finals Advancing Team<br />\n<br />\nFNCS Chapter 2 Season 5 Finals: Top 3 teams in each Region. Each team will nominate one (1) player to participate in High Tier (3 players total).<br />\n<br />\nFNCS Chapter 2 Season 6 Finals: Top 3 teams in each Region. Each team will nominate one (1) player to participate in High Tier (3 players total).<br />\n<br />\nNominations must be made to an Event Administrator by responding directly in the designated Event chatroom or by email no later than June 15, 2021 at 12:00 AM ET. If an FNCS Finals Advancing Team fails to submit its player nomination by such deadline, such team will lose its right to nominate a player to participate in High Tier. In such cases, the next highest ranked team from the applicable FNCS Finals will receive the right to nominate one (1) player to participate in High Tier within a new deadline to be set and announced by Event Administrators.<br />\n<br />\nWithout limitation of the foregoing, if an individual player or team has qualified for High Tier in both Season 5 and Season 6, the remaining spot(s) will instead be granted based on the next highest ranking team in the Season 6 Finals.<br />\n<br />\n2) Direct invitation from Epic<br />\n<br />\nTwo (2) players from each Region will be directly invited by Epic to participate in High Tier portion.<br />\n<br />\nTOTAL: 8 players per Region<br />\n<br />\n2.9&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Event Format and Scoring - FNCS All-Star Showdown Play For Keeps<br />\n<br />\n2.9.1&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Format<br />\n<br />\nIn the FNCS All-Star Showdown Play For Keeps (‚ÄúPlay For Keeps‚Äù), four (4) teams of three (3) players selected from each Region (as further described in Section 2.9.5) will compete across a total of two (2) stages, and seeding for each stage of Play For Keeps will be determined by Event Administrators at their sole discretion. For clarity, teams shall be prohibited from equipping or otherwise using the Fortnite ‚ÄúCrystal Llama‚Äù in-game cosmetic Back Bling at any point during any Play For Keeps match.<br />\n<br />\nPlay For Keeps competition will consist of head-to-head play in which teams will battle to maintain control over the in-Game llama (the ‚ÄúPlay For Keeps Llama‚Äù). For each Play For Keeps match, the team that maintains control of the Play For Keeps Llama for the longest period of time over the course of a round will be declared the winner of such round; and the first team to win two (2) out of three (3) rounds will be declared the winner of such match. For clarity, the Play For Keeps Llama is dropped upon being eliminated during a match, but there is no limit to the number of respawns by a team after being eliminated during a match.<br />\nThe first stage of the Play For Keeps will consist of a four (4) team double elimination bracket. If a team wins its first match during the first stage of the Play For Keeps, such team will advance to the second stage of the Play For Keeps (‚ÄúPlay For Keeps Finals‚Äù). If a team loses its first match during the first stage of the Play For Keeps, such team will be dropped down into the Play For Keeps third place bracket (‚ÄúPlay For Keeps Third Place Bracket‚Äù).<br />\nFor the Play For Keeps Finals, each team will compete against the other in a single elimination match to determine which team will be declared the Play For Keeps Champion. For the Play For Keeps Third Place Bracket, each team will compete against the other in a single elimination match to determine which team will be declared the Play For Keeps third place finisher.<br />\nAt the conclusion of the Play For Keeps Finals, and subject to the terms and conditions herein, each team from each Region will be awarded prizes as set out in Section 2.10.3.<br />\n<br />\n2.9.2&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Reporting Scores<br />\n<br />\nAt the conclusion of each Play For Keeps match, both winning and losing teams must submit the match result to Event Administrators using the designated chatroom.

If a team disputes a match claiming a win and submits proof of its claim, the opposing team must submit proof of its claim to avoid an automatic forfeit of the match. Any teams or players found to be submitting false or doctored results will be subject to disciplinary actions as further described in Section 9.2.<br />\n<br />\n2.9.3&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Tiebreakers<br />\n<br />\nIn the case of a tie (i.e., each team maintains control of the Play For Keeps Llama for the exact same amount of time at the conclusion of the applicable round or match), tiebreakers will be determined in the order presented here: (1) highest combined team eliminations; (2) lowest combined team deaths; and finally (3) highest combined team damage.<br />\n<br />\n2.9.4&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Event Administrator Instructions<br />\n<br />\nEvent Administrators will instruct players how to host and/or join each Play For Keeps match.

Additionally, players acknowledge that the different platforms may offer features, such as controllers, player interface, and/or ability to individualize certain game settings/sensitivities, etc., which may arguably provide a competitive advantage to one platform over another.

Epic reserves the right to seek damages and other remedies from such player to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nThe enforcement of any applicable punishment by Epic shall not provide such player with grounds for claims against Epic under any theory of law, or otherwise be considered a liability on the part of Epic to such player.<br />\n<br />\n9.2.3&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;If Epic decides that there have been repeated breaches of these Rules by a player, it may hand out increasing disciplinary action, up to and including permanent disqualification from all future competitive play of the Game. &nbsp;Epic may also enforce any applicable penalty specified in Epic‚Äôs Terms of Service and/or the Fortnite EULA.<br />\n<br />\n9.2.4&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;All Rules violations at the Event will be governed by the Epic Competitive Penalty Matrix. A final decision by Epic as to the appropriate disciplinary action will be final and binding on all players.<br />\n<br />\n9.3&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Rule Disputes<br />\n<br />\nEpic has final, binding authority to decide all disputes with respect to any portion of these Rules, including the breach, enforcement, or interpretation thereof.<br />\n<br />\n10.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Conditions<br />\n<br />\nThe Event is subject to these Rules.

By accepting a prize, the Winning Player agrees (or, if a Minor, such Winning Player‚Äôs parent or legal guardian agrees on such Winning Player‚Äôs behalf) to release Epic from any and all liability, loss, or damage arising from or in connection with awarding, receipt, and/or use or misuse of prize or participation in any prize-related activities. Epic shall not be liable for: (i) telephone system, telephone, or computer hardware, software, or other technical or computer malfunctions, lost connections, disconnections, delays, or transmission errors; (ii) data corruption, theft, destruction, and unauthorized access to or alteration of entry or other materials; (iii) any injuries, losses, or damages of any kind, including death caused by the prize or resulting from acceptance, possession, or use of a prize, or from participation in the Event; or (iv) any printing, typographical, administrative, or technological errors in any materials associated with the Event. Epic reserves the right to cancel or suspend the Event in its sole discretion or due to circumstances beyond its control, including natural disasters. Epic may disqualify any player from participating in the Event or winning a prize if, in its sole discretion, it determines such player is attempting to undermine the legitimate operation of the Event by cheating, hacking, deception, or any other unfair playing practices intending to annoy, abuse, threaten, undermine, or harass any other players or Epic‚Äôs representatives. The internal laws of the State of North Carolina, without reference to any of its conflicts of laws principles, shall govern disputes regarding these Rules and/or the Event. Epic may, in its sole discretion, cancel, modify, or suspend the Event should a virus, bug, computer problem, unauthorized intervention, force majeure, or other cause beyond Epic‚Äôs control corrupt the administration, security, or proper play of the Event. Any attempt to deliberately damage or undermine the legitimate operation of the Event may be in violation of criminal and civil laws and will result in disqualification from participation in the Event. &nbsp;Should such an attempt be made, Epic reserves the right to seek remedies and damages (including attorneys‚Äô fees) to the fullest extent of the law, including criminal prosecution.

Here‚Äôs the full breakdown of the four-round tournament.</p>\n\n<h3>Round 1</h3>\n\n<p>Open to all eligible Champion League Players</p>\n\n<h3>Round 2</h3>\n\n<p>Europe, NAE, NAW, and Brazil - Top 2000 players in each Region from Round 1<br />\nAsia, OCE, and Middle East - Top 1000 Players in each Region from Round 1</p>\n\n<h3>Round 3</h3>\n\n<p>Europe and NAE - Top 600 players in each Region from Round 2<br />\nNAW and Brazil - Top 500 players in each Region from Round 2<br />\nAsia, OCE, &amp; Middle East - Top 350 players in each Region from Round 2</p>\n\n<h3>Round 4</h3>\n\n<p>Top 100 players in each Region from Round 3<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Placement Points (Rounds 1-4)</strong><br />\nVictory Royale: 30 points<br />\n2nd: 25 points<br />\n3rd: 22 points<br />\n4th: 20 points<br />\n5th: 19 points<br />\n6th: 17 points<br />\n7th: 16 points<br />\n8th: 15 points<br />\n9th: 14 points<br />\n10th: 13 points<br />\n11th - 15th: 11 points<br />\n16th - 20th: 9 points<br />\n21st - 25th: 7 points<br />\n26th - 30th: 5 points<br />\n31st - 35th: 4 points<br />\n36th - 40th: 3 points<br />\n41st - 50th: 2 points<br />\n51st - 75th: 1 point</p>\n\n<p>Each Elimination: 1 point (2 points in Round 4)</p>\n\n<h2>Skills Challenges - June 23-24</h2>\n\n<p>Leading up to the FNCS All-Star Solo Championship on June 26, we'll be running three bracket-style Skills Challenges centered around Building, Editing, and Aiming. Partnering with ImmatureGamer, Enigma, and Dummblond, we‚Äôll be bringing you five different Fortnite Creative maps and a welcome hub that we‚Äôll be using during the entire event. These builders made some incredible islands specifically for the FNCS All-Star Showdown (and if you‚Äôd like, you can support them using code: FNCS-Allstar-Creators).</p>\n\n<p>Each Skills Challenge will be a double-elimination bracket-style competition with eight total players competing. The top 3 teams from Chapter 2 Season 5 and the top 3 teams from Chapter 2 Season 6 will designate one person from their respective trios to compete in the Skills Challenges. Additionally, we‚Äôve invited two players from each region to fill out the remaining two spots in each Skills Challenge. Only qualified or invited players to the FNCS All-Star Showdown Skills Challenges are eligible for prizes. The Skills Challenges include:</p>\n\n<h3>Blueprint Battle - June 23</h3>\n\n<p>Players will go head-to-head in the Blueprint Battle to determine who can make it through the edit course the fastest. Players will be challenged with different building edits in their way as they run through the map. Jump into the map yourself and see how fast you can get through the course. Share your results on Twitter using the #BlueprintBattle hashtag.<br />\n<strong>Creative Code: 3840-8537-4348</strong><br />\n<img alt=\"17BR Comp FNCS All Star MapScreenshots Blueprint\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/17br-comp-fncs-all-star-mapscreenshots-blueprint-1920x1080-c321e6eef30f.png\" style=\"height:auto; width:auto\" /></p>\n\n<h3>Bullseye Bonanza - June 23</h3>\n\n<p>Who has the best aim in Fortnite? Well we‚Äôre looking to find that out through the Bullseye Bonanza. Players will be forced to quickly shoot targets in succession in order to progress through the map. Build your aiming skill by playing Bullseye Bonanza in Creative.<br />\n<strong>Creative Code: 9420-6335-1309</strong><br />\n<img alt=\"17BR Comp FNCS All Star MapScreenshots BullseyeBonanza\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/17br-comp-fncs-all-star-mapscreenshots-bullseyebonanza-1920x1080-69f6f3a68269.png\" style=\"height:auto; width:auto\" /></p>\n\n<h3>High Tier&nbsp; - June 24</h3>\n\n<p>Players will be required to make it from Point A to Point B by tunneling, cranking 90s and waterfalling through High Tier. The faster player will advance to the next round. Improve your building skills by experiencing the map yourself.<br />\n<strong>Creative Code: 3947-8128-3885</strong><br />\n<img alt=\"17BR Comp FNCS All Star MapScreenshots HighTier\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/17br-comp-fncs-all-star-mapscreenshots-hightier-1920x1080-c6b69dfcb96b.png\" style=\"height:auto; width:auto\" /></p>\n\n<p>Winning players will advance through the upper bracket while the losing players will move on to the lower bracket. A player will be eliminated from the applicable Skills Challenge if they lose a matchup while in the lower bracket. Once a single player is left in the upper bracket and the lower bracket, those players will compete in the finals for that Skills Challenge. To win a Skills Challenge finals, the player in the lower bracket must win two matches while the player in the upper bracket will only need to win one match.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2>Play for Keeps - June 25</h2>\n\n<p>After the Skills Challenge wrap up, we‚Äôll be holding a team competition in a game called Play for Keeps that will showcase who‚Äôs got the best overall skills in Fortnite without the ability to build structures.</p>\n\n<p>This 3v3 game mode pits the top 4 FNCS trios in each region against each other in a single-elimination bracket. Teams will need to secure the Play for Keeps Llama and retain it to earn points. The other team will work to eliminate the holder of the Llama until it is in their possession.<br />\n<strong>Creative Code: 5892-6942-6261</strong><br />\n<img alt=\"17BR Comp FNCS All Star MapScreenshots PlayForKeeps\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/17br-comp-fncs-all-star-mapscreenshots-playforkeeps-1920x1080-4135049bfb7d.png\" style=\"height:auto; width:auto\" /></p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Bracket Example Png\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/bracket-example-png-1920x1080-83cf5b4b5c79.jpg\" style=\"height:auto; width:auto\" /></p>\n\n<p>Each Skills Challenge has money on the line!

Epic reserves the right to seek damages and other remedies from such player to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nThe enforcement of any applicable punishment by Epic shall not provide such player with grounds for claims against Epic under any theory of law, or otherwise be considered a liability on the part of Epic to such player.<br />\n<br />\n9.2.3 &nbsp; &nbsp;If Epic decides that there have been repeated breaches of these Rules by a player, it may hand out increasing disciplinary action, up to and including permanent disqualification from all future competitive play of the Game. &nbsp;Epic may also enforce any applicable penalty specified in Epic‚Äôs Terms of Service and/or the Fortnite EULA.<br />\n<br />\n9.2.4 &nbsp; &nbsp;All Rules violations at the Event will be governed by the Epic Competitive Penalty Matrix.

Epic reserves the right to seek damages and other remedies from such player to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nThe enforcement of any applicable punishment by Epic shall not provide such player with grounds for claims against Epic under any theory of law, or otherwise be considered a liability on the part of Epic to such player.<br />\n<br />\n9.2.3 &nbsp; &nbsp;If Epic decides that there have been repeated breaches of these Rules by a player, it may hand out increasing disciplinary action, up to and including permanent disqualification from all future competitive play of the Game. &nbsp;Epic may also enforce any applicable penalty specified in Epic‚Äôs Terms of Service and/or the Fortnite EULA.<br />\n<br />\n9.2.4 &nbsp; &nbsp;All Rules violations at the Event will be governed by the Epic Competitive Penalty Matrix. A final decision by Epic as to the appropriate disciplinary action will be final and binding on all players.<br />\n<br />\n9.3 &nbsp; &nbsp;Rule Disputes<br />\n<br />\nEpic has final, binding authority to decide all disputes with respect to any portion of these Rules, including the breach, enforcement, or interpretation thereof.<br />\n<br />\n10. &nbsp; &nbsp;Conditions<br />\n<br />\nThe Event is subject to these Rules.

Additionally, players acknowledge that the different platforms may offer features, such as controllers, player interface, and/or ability to individualize certain game settings/sensitivities, etc., which may arguably provide a competitive advantage to one platform over another.

Epic reserves the right to seek damages and other remedies from such player to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nThe enforcement of any applicable punishment by Epic shall not provide such player with grounds for claims against Epic under any theory of law, or otherwise be considered a liability on the part of Epic to such player.<br />\n<br />\n9.2.3 &nbsp; &nbsp;If Epic decides that there have been repeated breaches of these Rules by a player, it may hand out increasing disciplinary action, up to and including permanent disqualification from all future competitive play of the Game. &nbsp;Epic may also enforce any applicable penalty specified in Epic‚Äôs Terms of Service and/or the Fortnite EULA.<br />\n<br />\n9.2.4 &nbsp; &nbsp;All Rules violations at the Event will be governed by the Epic Competitive Penalty Matrix.

By accepting a prize, the Winning Player agrees (or, if a Minor, such Winning Player‚Äôs parent or legal guardian agrees on such Winning Player‚Äôs behalf) to release Epic from any and all liability, loss, or damage arising from or in connection with awarding, receipt, and/or use or misuse of prize or participation in any prize-related activities. Epic shall not be liable for: (i) telephone system, telephone, or computer hardware, software, or other technical or computer malfunctions, lost connections, disconnections, delays, or transmission errors; (ii) data corruption, theft, destruction, and unauthorized access to or alteration of entry or other materials; (iii) any injuries, losses, or damages of any kind, including death caused by the prize or resulting from acceptance, possession, or use of a prize, or from participation in the Event; or (iv) any printing, typographical, administrative, or technological errors in any materials associated with the Event. Epic reserves the right to cancel or suspend the Event in its sole discretion or due to circumstances beyond its control, including natural disasters. Epic may disqualify any player from participating in the Event or winning a prize if, in its sole discretion, it determines such player is attempting to undermine the legitimate operation of the Event by cheating, hacking, deception, or any other unfair playing practices intending to annoy, abuse, threaten, undermine, or harass any other players or Epic‚Äôs representatives. The internal laws of the State of North Carolina, without reference to any of its conflicts of laws principles, shall govern disputes regarding these Rules and/or the Event. Epic may, in its sole discretion, cancel, modify, or suspend the Event should a virus, bug, computer problem, unauthorized intervention, force majeure, or other cause beyond Epic‚Äôs control corrupt the administration, security, or proper play of the Event.

We‚Äôre excited to share all the details with you soon, and not every spot in the All-Star Showdown has been filled‚Ä¶ üëÄ Stay tuned shortly after Season 7‚Äôs launch for more details about the FNCS All-Star Showdown, as well as a yet-to-be-announced early season tournament.</p>\n\n<h2>Fortnite Arena Reset</h2>\n\n<p>Because we‚Äôll be hosting that early season tournament, we‚Äôre not going to reset the Arena Hype at the beginning of Chapter 2 Season 7. In order to participate in that tournament, you‚Äôll need to be in Champion League (among other requirements, which we‚Äôll detail in the official rules for that tournament), so we‚Äôre holding the reset until June 22.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>During this time, core Arena modes will take in everything the new season has to offer and we‚Äôll be monitoring how the new items and features translate to competitive games before any adjustments are made.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2>Season 7 FNCS Begins July 29</h2>\n\n<p>Following the FNCS All-Star Showdown, we‚Äôll take a two-week break (June 28 - July 11) on all competitions. We‚Äôll be taking some time to relax and recharge, and you should too.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>We‚Äôll hold our first Season 7 FNCS Qualifier on July 29 (Middle East) and July 30 (all other regions). The Season 7 FNCS Finals will conclude on September 5. Here‚Äôs the full breakdown:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Qualifier 1:</strong> Middle East - July 29-31. All other regions - July 30 - August 1.<br />\n<strong>Bye Week:</strong> August 5-8.<br />\n<strong>Qualifier 2:</strong> Middle East - August 12-14. All other regions - August 13-15.<br />\n<strong>Qualifier 3:</strong> Middle East - August 19-22. All other regions - August 20-22.<br />\n<strong>Semi-Finals:</strong> Middle East - August 27. All other regions - August 28.<br />\n<strong>Reboot Round:</strong> Middle East - August 28. All other regions - August 29.<br />\n<strong>Finals:</strong> Middle East - September 3-4. All other regions - September 4-5.</p>\n\n<h3>Format</h3>\n\n<p>As announced at the start of the year, Season 7 FNCS will be played in Trios. Last season we saw lots of positive feedback on the changes we made, including the point format. With that in mind, Season 7 will have a familiar format with minor adjustments.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Each new season of FNCS has brought with it adjustments to the point or qualification format, but we like where we currently stand and are eager to see the long-term effects of a more standardized FNCS across multiple seasons. We‚Äôll briefly explain why below.</p>\n\n<h4>Qualifiers</h4>\n\n<p>We really liked the way the Season 6 Qualifiers played out with the top 3 teams advancing straight to Finals. Teams had a lot to play for and each game in Round 4 held a lot of weight. Series Points also became more valuable. And like last season, anyone in Champion League can still form a trio with other Champion League players and openly compete in FNCS!</p>\n\n<p>As a minor tweak, Oceania will have slightly fewer teams advancing from Round 1 to Round 2, but otherwise everything else will remain the same.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h4>Semi-Finals</h4>\n\n<p>We view the Semi-Finals stage of FNCS as a high-stakes environment and plan to keep the same format as last season, where every team has something to play for in the final game - whether that‚Äôs top 6 for Finals or top 17 for Reboot Round. Players have to prove they belong in the FNCS Finals when the pressure is on.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h4>Reboot Round</h4>\n\n<p>We admittedly were curious if having multiple Reboot Round games would diminish the hype for this stage, but you all showed how awesome and exciting these winner-take-all matches can be. We saw amazing performances across different regions to clinch the remaining spots in the FNCS Finals. We‚Äôre keeping the Reboot Round at 3+ games and feel as though this last-chance stage helps round out the rigours of the Semi-Finals.</p>\n\n<h4>Finals</h4>\n\n<p>We‚Äôre looking to provide more team stability from season to season, and with the top 3 teams from the previous FNCS Finals advancing straight to the next season‚Äôs FNCS Finals, we‚Äôd like to keep everything the same in the Finals.</p>\n\n<h4>Automatic Qualifiers for the Finals</h4>\n\n<p>If you placed in the top 3 from your region‚Äôs FNCS Finals during Season 6, you‚Äôve automatically earned a spot in the Season 7 FNCS Finals -- so long as your entire trio sticks together. If you wish to disband your trio, you and your teammates must fill out the <a href=\"https://disband.questionpro.com\">official disband form</a> no later than August 16. Alternatively, if you wish to stay with your trio and compete in the FNCS Qualifiers instead, you and your entire trio will still need to fill out the disband form by the stated deadline. The choice is in your hands, but keep in mind that by filling out the disband form, you and your trio will essentially be forfeiting your guaranteed spots in the Season 7 FNCS Finals. A final reminder that for each team that fills out the disband form, we will add an extra Reboot Round in that region!</p>\n\n<h4>Prize Pool</h4>\n\n<p>You‚Äôll have the opportunity to earn a share of the $3,000,000 prize pool. We‚Äôve slightly altered the prizing allocation to better represent the competitive engagement and participation from each region.</p>\n\n<div>\n<table cellspacing=\"0\">\n\t<colgroup>\n\t\t<col />\n\t\t<col />\n\t\t<col />\n\t\t<col />\n\t\t<col />\n\t\t<col />\n\t\t<col />\n\t</colgroup>\n\t<tbody>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>EU</strong></p>\n\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>NAE</strong></p>\n\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>BR</strong></p>\n\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>NAW</strong></p>\n\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>ASIA</strong></p>\n\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>ME</strong></p>\n\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>OCE</strong></p>\n\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t<p style=\"text-align:center\">$1,351,200</p>\n\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t<p style=\"text-align:center\">$635,100</p>\n\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t<p style=\"text-align:center\">$428,175</p>\n\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t<p style=\"text-align:center\">$222,300</p>\n\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t<p style=\"text-align:center\">$150,600</p>\n\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t<p style=\"text-align:center\">$122,250</p>\n\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t<p style=\"text-align:center\">$90,450</p>\n\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n\n<h2>Cash Cups and Other Competitive Offerings</h2>\n\n<p>In addition to FNCS, we‚Äôll continue our normal weekly competitive weekly offerings of Trios Cash Cups and Hype Cups, Solo Cash Cups, and LTM tournaments. We‚Äôll hold the Trios Cash Cups and Hype Cups on Mondays, LTM tournaments on Saturdays, and the Solo Cash Cups on Sundays throughout the season. The first Cash Cup of the season will be on July 12.</p>\n\n<p>The Cash Cups will continue to play into the DreamHack Cash Cup Extras in EU and NA-East. We‚Äôll have Cash Cup Extra events on July 14, July 21 and August 25. Additionally, make sure to bring your A game for the Trios Cash Cups on July 12, July 19, and August 23.</p>\n\n<p>DreamHack will also once again hold an open tournament starting in August. So be sure to stay tuned to our and DreamHack Fortnite‚Äôs social channels for dates and times!</p>\n\n<p>Finally, we‚Äôve decided to discontinue Friday Nite Bragging Rights. We haven‚Äôt settled on a weekly replacement yet; however, we do plan on having additional tournaments on Friday nights in one form or another.</p>\n\n<h3>Console Cup</h3>\n\n<p>Just as we promised, the Console Cup will be a seasonal offering with a $250,000 prize pool, and we‚Äôve got it slated for July 22-25. Console players, this means you‚Äôll have about a month to reach Champion League.

Epic reserves the right to cancel or suspend the Event in its sole discretion or due to circumstances beyond its control, including natural disasters. Epic may disqualify any player from participating in the Event or winning a prize if, in its sole discretion, it determines such player is attempting to undermine the legitimate operation of the Event by cheating, hacking, deception, or any other unfair playing practices intending to annoy, abuse, threaten, undermine, or harass any other players or Epic‚Äôs representatives. The internal laws of the State of North Carolina, without reference to any of its conflicts of laws principles, shall govern disputes regarding these Rules and/or the Event.

If a player qualifies to Stage 2 multiple times with different teams through the Series Points advancement as listed in Section 2.5.9, the team with the higher Series Points value will be the qualified team and the team with the lower Series Points value will not be valid.

In particular, players shall not engage in harassing or disrespectful conduct, use of abusive or offensive language, game sabotage, spamming, social engineering, scamming, or any unlawful activity (‚ÄúToxic Behavior‚Äù).<br />\n<br />\n8.1.4 &nbsp; &nbsp;Players shall not (a) proclaim to be, or represent themselves as, a banned player or a cheater/rule breaker, or (b) glorify or otherwise endorse the breaking or violation of these Rules.<br />\n<br />\n8.1.5 &nbsp; &nbsp;Any violation of these Rules may expose a player to disciplinary action as further described in Section 9.2, whether or not that violation was committed intentionally.<br />\n<br />\n8.2 &nbsp; &nbsp;Competitive Integrity<br />\n<br />\n8.2.1 &nbsp; &nbsp;Each player is expected to play within the spirit of the Game and these Rules at all times during any Event match. &nbsp;Any form of unfair play is prohibited by these Rules, and may result in disciplinary action. &nbsp;Examples of unfair play include the following:<br />\n<br />\nCollusion (as defined below), match fixing or throwing, bribing a referee or match official, or any other unfair or illegal action or agreement to intentionally influence (or attempt to influence) the outcome of any match or Event.<br />\n<br />\nHacking or otherwise modifying the intended behavior of the Game client.<br />\n<br />\nPlaying or allowing another player to play on an Epic account registered in another person‚Äôs name (or soliciting, encouraging, or directing someone else to do so).<br />\n<br />\nUsing any kind of cheating device, program, or similar cheating method to gain a competitive advantage.<br />\n<br />\nIntentionally exploiting any game function (e.g., an in-game bug or glitch) in a manner not intended by Epic in order to gain a competitive advantage.<br />\n<br />\nUsing distributed denial of service attacks, swatting, or similar methods to interfere with another player‚Äôs connection to the Game‚Äôs game client.<br />\n<br />\nUsing macro keys or similar methods to automate in-game actions.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nAccepting any gift, reward, bribe, or compensation for services promised, rendered, or to be rendered in connection with unfair play of the Game (e.g., services designed to throw or fix a match or session).<br />\n<br />\nUtilizing outside assistance regarding the location of other players, other players‚Äô health or equipment, or any other information not otherwise known to the player by the information on his or her own screen (e.g., looking at or attempting to look at spectator monitors while currently in a match). For clarity, a player‚Äôs receipt of coaching or use of the in-game replay tool does not fall within this prohibition.<br />\n<br />\nIntentionally disconnecting from the Game while in a knocked down, Down-But-Not-Out (‚ÄúDBNO‚Äù) state. For clarity, this does not apply to players who intentionally disconnect while not in a DBNO state.<br />\n<br />\n8.2.2 &nbsp; &nbsp;Players may not work together to deceive or otherwise cheat other players during any match (‚ÄúCollusion‚Äù). Examples of Collusion include the following:<br />\n<br />\nTeaming: Players working together during the match while on opposing teams.<br />\n<br />\nPlanned Movement: Agreement between 2 or more opposing players to land at specific locations or to move through the map in a planned way before the match begins.<br />\n<br />\nCommunication: Sending or receiving signals (both verbal and non-verbal) to communicate with opposing players.<br />\n<br />\nItem Dumping: Intentionally dropping items for an opposing player to collect.<br />\n<br />\nFeeding: Intentionally allowing oneself to be eliminated by an opposing player.<br />\n<br />\n8.3 &nbsp; &nbsp;Wagering&nbsp;<br />\nPlayers shall not (a) conduct or promote betting, wagering, or gambling on the Event or any portion thereof, or (b) benefit, either directly or indirectly, from betting, wagering, or gambling on the Event or any portion thereof.<br />\n8.4 &nbsp; &nbsp;Harassment<br />\n<br />\n8.4.1 &nbsp; &nbsp;Players are prohibited from engaging in any form of harassing, abusive, or discriminatory conduct based on race, color, ethnicity, national origin, religion, political opinion or any other opinion, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, age, disability, or any other status or characteristic protected under applicable law.<br />\n<br />\n8.4.2 &nbsp; &nbsp;Any player who witnesses or is subjected to harassing, abusive, or discriminatory conduct should notify an Epic Esports Coordinator or Event Administrator.

Retaliation against any player who brings forward a complaint or cooperates in the investigation of a complaint is prohibited.<br />\n<br />\n8.5 &nbsp; &nbsp;Confidentiality<br />\n<br />\nA player may not disclose to any third party any confidential information provided by the Event Administrators, Epic, or its affiliates concerning the Game, the Event, Epic, or its affiliates, by any method of communication, including by posting on social media channels.<br />\n<br />\n8.6 &nbsp; &nbsp;Illegal Conduct<br />\n<br />\nPlayers are required to comply with all applicable laws at all times.<br />\n<br />\n9. &nbsp; &nbsp;Rules and Conduct Violations<br />\n<br />\n9.1 &nbsp; &nbsp;Investigation and Compliance<br />\n<br />\nPlayers agree to fully cooperate with Epic and/or an Event Administrator (as applicable) in the investigation of any violation of these Rules. If Epic and/or an Event Administrator contacts a player to discuss the investigation, the player must be truthful in the information that he or she provides to Epic and/or an Event Administrator. Any player found to have withheld, destroyed, or tampered with any related information, or otherwise found to have misled Epic and/or an Event Administrator during an investigation, will be subject to disciplinary action as further described in Section 9.2.<br />\n<br />\n9.2 &nbsp; &nbsp;Disciplinary Action<br />\n<br />\n9.2.1 &nbsp; &nbsp;If Epic decides that a player has violated the Code, Epic may take the following disciplinary actions (as applicable):<br />\n<br />\nIssue a private or public warning (verbal or written) to the player;<br />\n<br />\nLoss of session points for the current or future match(es);<br />\n<br />\nLoss of all or any part of the prizes previously awarded to the player;<br />\n<br />\nDisqualify the player from participating in one or more matches and/or sessions at the Event; or<br />\n<br />\nPrevent the player from participating in one or more future competitions hosted by Epic.<br />\n<br />\n9.2.2 &nbsp; &nbsp;For clarity, the nature and extent of the disciplinary action taken by Epic pursuant to this Section 9.2 will be in the sole and absolute discretion of Epic. Epic reserves the right to seek damages and other remedies from such player to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nThe enforcement of any applicable punishment by Epic shall not provide such player with grounds for claims against Epic under any theory of law, or otherwise be considered a liability on the part of Epic to such player.<br />\n<br />\n9.2.3 &nbsp; &nbsp;If Epic decides that there have been repeated breaches of these Rules by a player, it may hand out increasing disciplinary action, up to and including permanent disqualification from all future competitive play of the Game. &nbsp;Epic may also enforce any applicable penalty specified in Epic‚Äôs Terms of Service and/or the Fortnite EULA.<br />\n<br />\n9.2.4 &nbsp; &nbsp;All Rules violations at the Event will be governed by the Epic Competitive Penalty Matrix. A final decision by Epic as to the appropriate disciplinary action will be final and binding on all players.<br />\n<br />\n9.3 &nbsp; &nbsp;Rule Disputes<br />\n<br />\nEpic has final, binding authority to decide all disputes with respect to any portion of these Rules, including the breach, enforcement, or interpretation thereof.<br />\n<br />\n10. &nbsp; &nbsp;Conditions<br />\n<br />\nThe Event is subject to these Rules.

In order to make sure that everyone is on the same page when it comes to what is and what is not permissible in our tournaments, let‚Äôs take a deeper look into some of our most commonly violated competitive rules.</p>\n\n<h3>Intentional Disconnect</h3>\n\n<p>We established this rule to prevent teams from leaving a match as a defense against an opponent‚Äôs use of the Shakedown gameplay mechanic (which, if properly used, would allow that opponent to obtain that team‚Äôs positional information). Intentionally disconnecting from a match in an attempt to gain an unfair advantage goes against the spirit of Fortnite competition. Accordingly, all players must be sure not to disconnect from the game while in a knocked down, ‚ÄúDown-But-Not-Out‚Äù (DBNO) state. Note that this does not apply to players who intentionally disconnect while not in a DBNO state.</p>\n\n<h3>Illegal Restart</h3>\n\n<p>In December, we amended our rules to specify that players can only have one entry (using one Epic account) into a tournament for a given session. This means that once you start a tournament as part of a team, <strong>you are locked with that team for the entire tournament session</strong>. We established this rule to prevent players from restarting a tournament with a separate account or with a new team after a poor start.</p>\n\n<p>Please note: any attempt by a player to restart a tournament with a different team will trigger an automatic disqualification (DQ) from that tournament. Players may also be subject to escalating penalties for any additional illegal restart. With that in mind, be careful not to switch parties or teammates when competing in a tournament.</p>\n\n<h3>Region Locking</h3>\n\n<p>Fortnite assigns each player to a regional server based on the response time between a player‚Äôs hardware and the Fortnite servers. Most players will play in tournaments based on their auto-assigned region for the best gaming experience. However, there are some players who are interested in playing some additional matches in a tournament, and so choose to switch regions and get a few more games in, even if it means a slower server response time.</p>\n\n<p>Some of our tournaments are restricted to only one regional entry via a Region Lock, while other tournaments are open for full cross-regional participation. To make it easier to determine when a tournament has a Region Lock restriction, we‚Äôve added the following <strong>bolded</strong> language to the existing Rule 3.7.4 for all such tournaments:<br />\n<br />\n<em>Players are expressly prohibited from having additional Event entries using additional or secondary Epic account(s), <strong>and/or participating from more than one (1) server region.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></em></p>\n\n<p>Here are a couple of examples from recent tournaments to help clarify:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">Cash Cups are <strong>NOT</strong> currently region locked. You may compete in the same Monday Cash Cup on the EU, NAE and NAW server regions.</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">FNCS <strong>IS</strong> currently region locked. You may only participate in a single region, and you will be locked to the first region that you select in your first Qualifier of that particular Season‚Äôs FNCS.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>As noted above, some of our tournaments allow for this, others do not. You will need to be aware of which tournaments restrict play to a single region so you prioritize the region you wish to compete in.</p>\n\n<h2>Additional Competitive Reminders</h2>\n\n<h3>Leaderboard Adjustments</h3>\n\n<p>After a tournament has ended, it may be necessary for us to adjust that tournament‚Äôs leaderboard. While there are many reasons for making a leaderboard adjustment, it is usually due to players or teams being DQ‚Äôd and removed from the leaderboard for breaking tournament rules.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, one limitation we currently face with adjusting the leaderboards is the time it takes to complete the process. Depending on the reason behind the adjustment, this process can take anywhere from several hours to several days or longer to complete.</p>\n\n<p>This delay in finalizing official leaderboard standings is a primary reason why we may sometimes wait weeks before starting the process of awarding prizes to potential winners.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>For tournaments that award an advancement to play in a future round, (like the FNCS Qualifiers), we‚Äôre unable to guarantee finalized leaderboard updates in the short window of time before the next round starts. Therefore, at the end of the round, the leaderboard at that moment is snapshotted, and those advancements are immediately awarded and considered ‚Äúfinal‚Äù for the purpose of player or team advancement only.<br />\n<br />\nTo summarize, for round-to-round advancement, we advance players/teams directly from a snapshot of the leaderboard at the conclusion of the round. For events with cash prizes, we delay distribution of those potential prizes until we‚Äôre confident the leaderboards are finalized.</p>\n\n<h3>Competitive Warning/Ban Implications</h3>\n\n<p>Players should always strive to stay within our rules, but they should also understand the consequences of falling out of line with those rules. Depending on the nature of the infraction, disciplinary actions can include, but not be limited to, a public warning, loss of session points, loss of prizes, or a DQ from a current or future tournament. Repeated or excessive rules infractions may result in increasing disciplinary action, up to and including permanent DQ from all future competitive play of Fortnite.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Importantly, if a player on a team receives a DQ for a tournament due to a rules infraction, all players on that team will also receive a DQ for that tournament, so be sure to choose your teammates wisely and hold each other accountable.</p>\n\n<p>Disciplinary action can also be imposed for certain player behavior outside of the game, including, but not limited to, harassment, toxic behavior, or promoting oneself as a banned or cheating player.</p>\n\n<p>In all instances, the nature and extent of the disciplinary action taken by Epic pursuant to our competitive rules will be in the sole and absolute discretion of Epic.</p>\n\n<h3>Key Remappers</h3>\n\n<p>To be clear, key remappers are permitted within Fortnite. Players rely on these tools and certain hardware that apply the same effect in order to play the game. The spirit of our rules allow for players to reconfigure keybinds in a way that wouldn‚Äôt be possible inside the game, including double-movement on keyboards. Using these tools to automate multiple actions (e.g., mapping a single button to place multiple building structures), however, is not permitted.</p>\n\n<h3>Wagering</h3>\nAs a reminder, our competitive rules, along with the <a href=\"https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/community-rules?sessionInvalidated=true\" target=\"_blank\">Epic Games Community Rules</a>, prohibit any promotion-of or engagement-in betting, wagering, or gambling associated with Epic Games products. <strong>Betting, wagering, or gambling on any Fortnite match or game may result in one or more of the disciplinary actions discussed above ‚Äì including, but not limited to, official warnings or an account ban.</strong><br />\n<br />\nThis hopefully provides additional clarity surrounding our competitive rules, and in particular, permissible behavior in our tournaments. Thank you for competing in Fortnite and helping to keep Fortnite fun, fair, and safe for all players.","description":"Read the latest Fortnite Competitive Rules clarifications heading into Chapter 2 Season 6 covering intentional disconnects, region locking, illegal restart, Leaderboard adjustments, bans and more.","date":"2021-04-20T16:55:00.000Z","trending":false,"images":{"image":"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/15br-comp-3rdpartyevergreens-v2-green-newsthumbnail-576x576-e28c3ddf1e1c.jpg","share":"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/15br-comp-3rdpartyevergreens-v2-green-social-1920x1080-5bce21411e40.jpg","trending":"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/15br-comp-3rdpartyevergreens-v2-green-newsheader-1920x1080-2f22ce3facea.jpg"},"author":"The Fortnite Team","url":"https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/competitive/news/fortnite-competitive-rules-clarifications","nextPost":"https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/competitive/blog/neymar-jr-cup-official-rules","prevPost":"https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/competitive/blog/aloy-cup-only-on-ps4-ps5-official-rules"},{"id":"cc508e44-374c-4aef-bba6-af23a4d2067d","title":"Aloy Cup Only On PS4 & PS5 - Official Rules","content":"Aloy Cup Only On PS4 &amp; PS5 - Official Rules<br />\n<br />\n1.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Introduction and Acceptance<br />\n<br />\n1.1&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Introduction<br />\n<br />\nThese Aloy Cup Only On PS4 &amp; PS5 Official Rules (‚ÄúRules‚Äù) govern all stages of the Aloy Cup Only On PS4 &amp; PS5 (‚ÄúAloy Cup Only On PS4 &amp; PS5‚Äù or ‚ÄúEvent‚Äù).

By accepting a prize, the Winning Player agrees (or, if a Minor, such Winning Player‚Äôs parent or legal guardian agrees on such Winning Player‚Äôs behalf) to release Epic from any and all liability, loss, or damage arising from or in connection with awarding, receipt, and/or use or misuse of prize or participation in any prize-related activities.

All other regions - April 23-25<br />\n<strong>Qualifier 2:</strong> Middle East - April 29-May 1. All other regions - April 30-May 2<br />\n<strong>Qualifier 3:</strong> Middle East - May 6-8.

With one cross-platform player pool per region, here‚Äôs the full breakdown:</p>\n&nbsp;\n\n<div>\n<table cellspacing=\"0\">\n\t<colgroup>\n\t\t<col />\n\t\t<col />\n\t\t<col />\n\t\t<col />\n\t\t<col />\n\t\t<col />\n\t\t<col />\n\t</colgroup>\n\t<tbody>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t<p style=\"text-align:center\">EU</p>\n\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t<p style=\"text-align:center\">NAE</p>\n\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t<p style=\"text-align:center\">NAW</p>\n\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t<p style=\"text-align:center\">BR</p>\n\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t<p style=\"text-align:center\">ASIA</p>\n\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t<p style=\"text-align:center\">ME</p>\n\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t<p style=\"text-align:center\">OCE</p>\n\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t<p>$1,350,000</p>\n\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t<p>$690,000</p>\n\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t<p>$300,000</p>\n\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t<p>$300,000</p>\n\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t<p>$150,000</p>\n\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t<p>$120,000</p>\n\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t<p>$90,000</p>\n\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n\n<h2>Format</h2>\n\n<p>We‚Äôve made slight adjustments to this season‚Äôs qualification format. As a reminder, teams that placed 1st, 2nd, or 3rd in last season‚Äôs (Chapter 2 Season 5) FNCS for their respective region already qualify into Finals for Chapter 2 Season 6 and cannot participate in the Qualifiers or Semi-Finals.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> If those teams wish to disband before the start of FNCS, all three members of the Trio must fill out the official disband form by April 19.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Quick highlights (A full breakdown of each can be found below):</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">Top 3 teams from each Qualifier will skip Semi-Finals and directly advance&nbsp;to Finals. All other teams earn Series Points for the opportunity to advance to Semi-Finals.</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">All regions will have three Heats (instead of four last season) in Semi-Finals and the Heats will be played on the same day.</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">Reboot Round is expanded and will have, at a minimum, three matches and up to six matches total.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Qualifiers</h3>\n\n<p>For each Qualifier, teams that place in the top 3 of that Qualifier&nbsp;will now skip Semi-Finals and advance straight to Finals.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Teams that do not place in the top 3 of a Qualifier will be awarded Series Points based on their final placement in that Qualifier. At the conclusion of the final Qualifier, all Series Points will be added together, and the top-99 Trios on the Series Point leaderboard will advance to the Semi-Finals in each region.</p>\n\n<h3>Semi-Finals</h3>\n\n<p>Semi-Finals will consist of 3 Heats in each region, with teams seeded based on the total amount of Series Points earned across all Qualifiers. For each Heat, teams will have 6 matches to earn as many points as they can. The top 6 Trios from each Heat will advance to Finals. Teams placing 7th-17th in each Heat will advance to the Reboot Round.</p>\n\n<h3>Reboot Round</h3>\n\n<p>Reboot Round will now consist of at least 3 matches in which the winning team of each match will advance to Finals. Once a team gets a Victory Royale, they will move on to Finals and will be removed from the next set of matches of the Reboot Round. Additional matches - up to 6 total - may be added if any teams disband who had guaranteed Finals invitations based on last season‚Äôs (Chapter 2 Season 5 FNCS) standings.</p>\n\n<h3>Finals</h3>\n\n<p>Finals will remain unchanged. Teams will have 12 total matches across 2 days to earn points before we crown our Chapter 2 Season 6 FNCS Champions.</p>\n\n<h4>Rationale For Format Changes</h4>\n\n<p>Looking back to the last FNCS, of the 70 teams that directly qualified to Semi-Finals from the first Qualifier in Season 5, 52 made it through to Finals (74%). Those 52 teams averaged 11th place across all regions, and 28 of the 52 teams placed in the top 10 in their respective region, including 3 FNCS Championship Trios. In short, the teams that qualified from the first Qualifier last season not only made it to Finals, but were more dominant than other teams. Like last season, prizes will be allocated for every team that makes it to&nbsp;the Finals to ensure that standout performances from the Qualifiers or the previous season are rewarded.</p>\n\n<p>We‚Äôve also adjusted Series Points reward values at the end of each individual Qualifier, which we hope will facilitate&nbsp;a more competitive experience in the Qualifiers.</p>\n\n<h2>Scoring</h2>\n\n<p>Based on player feedback on last season‚Äôs point format, we‚Äôve made adjustments for single-lobby rounds. We‚Äôve decided to award points more evenly across the top and at pivotal points during a match. Specifically, teams that make it past Storm Surge thresholds will be rewarded as these are the more difficult placement thresholds. Incremental points are awarded from 16th and onward with a solid bump for earning that coveted Victory Royale.</p>\nVictory Royale: 30<br />\n2nd: 26<br />\n3rd: 24<br />\n4th: 22<br />\n5th: 21<br />\n6th: 20<br />\n7th: 19<br />\n8th: 18<br />\n9th: 17<br />\n10th: 16<br />\n11th: 14<br />\n12th: 13<br />\n13th: 12<br />\n14th: 11<br />\n15th: 10<br />\n16th: 9<br />\n17th: 8<br />\n18th-24th: 5\n<p>Each Elimination: 2 Points</p>\n\n<p>The scoring format for earlier rounds that do not use a single lobby system (Round 1, Round 2, and Round 3) will remain unchanged from last season.</p>\n\n<p>The Chapter 2 Season 6 FNCS Official Rules will be coming soon and can be found in our <a href=\"https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/competitive/rules-library\">Rules Library</a> when posted.</p>\n\n<h2>FNCS All-Star Showdown</h2>\n\n<p>The competition continues after Chapter 2 Season 6 FNCS with the FNCS All-Star Showdown on June 23-26. The main event will be a Solo Tournament featuring the top players in each region from the past two FNCS tournaments. The top 15 teams from Chapter 2 Season 5 FNCS and the top 15 teams from Chapter 2 Season 6 FNCS will receive invitations to the FNCS All-Star Showdown for a total of 90 players competing to determine who is the best player in their region. This means that half of the field is already set, so there‚Äôs even more on the line for the Chapter 2 Season 6 FNCS.</p>\n\n<p>If some teams or players placed in the top 15 in both seasons, we‚Äôll invite additional players to fill the open spots based on consistency. Players with the highest average performance between Season 5 and Season 6 will receive an invitation to fill those potential extra slots.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>A handful of invited players will also have the opportunity to compete as individuals in Creative Mode skills challenges during the days leading into the Solo championship. The FNCS All-Star Showdown will have a total combined prize pool of $3,000,000 across all events with more details to come later this season! Stay tuned.</p>\n\n<p>We can‚Äôt wait to see you compete in this season‚Äôs FNCS!

The internal laws of the State of North Carolina, without reference to any of its conflicts of laws principles, shall govern disputes regarding these Rules and/or the Event. Event Organizer or Epic may, in each party‚Äôs sole discretion, cancel, modify, or suspend the Event should a virus, bug, computer problem, unauthorized intervention, force majeure, or other cause beyond such party‚Äôs control corrupt the administration, security, or proper play of the Event.

Epic may withhold payment of the prizes if the Winning Player fails to provide the applicable payment forms to Epic in a timely manner.<br />\nPRIZES ARE SUBJECT TO APPLICABLE INTERNATIONAL, FEDERAL, STATE, AND LOCAL TAXES (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, INCOME AND WITHHOLDING TAXES) &nbsp;AND IT IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF EACH WINNING PLAYER TO (I) CHECK WITH HIS OR HER LOCAL TAX ADVISOR TO DETERMINE WHICH TAXES APPLY TO HIM OR HER AND (II) PAY SUCH TAXES TO THE APPROPRIATE TAX AUTHORITY. &nbsp;It is Epic's policy to withhold tax at the backup withholding rates in effect for US and non-US residents. &nbsp;Prize income and tax withholding will be reported on forms (y) 1099-MISC for US residents and 1042-S for non-US residents, and (z) any other relevant tax forms as may be required by applicable law.&nbsp;<br />\nEpic will determine the payment method for the prizes in its sole discretion and, except as otherwise required by applicable law, all payments will be made directly to the Winning Player in his or her capacity as an individual (or, if a Minor, to the Winning Player‚Äôs parent or legal guardian). &nbsp;For the avoidance of doubt, no prize payments will be made by Epic to any organization, company, or other entity. &nbsp;Each Winning Player will be provided a Prize Acceptance and Release Form (‚ÄúRelease‚Äù). &nbsp;Unless restricted by applicable law, each Winning Player (or, if a Minor, such Winning Player‚Äôs parent or legal guardian) will be required to complete and submit the Release in accordance with the deadlines set forth in this Section 2.5.2.<br />\n3.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Player Eligibility<br />\n<br />\n3.1&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Player Age<br />\n<br />\n3.1.1&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;To be eligible to participate in any Event match, a player must be at least 13 years old (or such other age, if greater, as may be required in such player‚Äôs country of residence). &nbsp;If a player is under 18 years of age or the age of majority as defined in such player‚Äôs country of residence (a ‚ÄúMinor‚Äù), such player must have permission from a parent or legal guardian in order to participate in the Event.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n3.1.2&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Ineligible players who mislead or attempt to mislead Event Administrators by providing false eligibility information will be subject to disciplinary actions as further described in Section 9.2.<br />\n<br />\n3.2&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Fortnite EULA<br />\n<br />\nEach player must follow the Fortnite End User License Agreement (‚ÄúFortnite EULA‚Äù) (https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/eula).

For clarity, a player‚Äôs receipt of coaching or use of the in-game replay tool does not fall within this prohibition.<br />\n<br />\nIntentionally disconnecting from the Game while in a knocked down, Down-But-Not-Out (‚ÄúDBNO‚Äù) state. For clarity, this does not apply to players who intentionally disconnect while not in a DBNO state.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n8.2.2&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Players may not work together to deceive or otherwise cheat other players during any match (‚ÄúCollusion‚Äù).

Epic reserves the right to seek damages and other remedies from such player to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.<br />\nThe enforcement of any applicable punishment by Epic shall not provide such player with grounds for claims against Epic under any theory of law, or otherwise be considered a liability on the part of Epic to such player.<br />\n9.2.3&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;If Epic decides that there have been repeated breaches of these Rules by a player, it may hand out increasing disciplinary action, up to and including permanent disqualification from all future competitive play of the Game. &nbsp;Epic may also enforce any applicable penalty specified in Epic‚Äôs Terms of Service and/or the Fortnite EULA.<br />\n<br />\n9.2.4&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;All Rules violations at the Event will be governed by the Epic Competitive Penalty Matrix. A final decision by Epic as to the appropriate disciplinary action will be final and binding on all players.<br />\n<br />\n9.3&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Rule Disputes<br />\n<br />\nEpic has final, binding authority to decide all disputes with respect to any portion of these Rules, including the breach, enforcement, or interpretation thereof.<br />\n<br />\n10.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Conditions<br />\n<br />\nThe Event is subject to these Rules. By participating, each player agrees (or, if a Minor, such player‚Äôs parent or legal guardian agrees on such player‚Äôs behalf): (a) to be bound by these complete Rules (including the Code of Conduct) and the decisions of Epic which shall be final and binding; and (b) to waive any right to claim ambiguity in the Event or these Rules, except where prohibited by applicable law. By accepting a prize, the Winning Player agrees (or, if a Minor, such Winning Player‚Äôs parent or legal guardian agrees on such Winning Player‚Äôs behalf) to release Epic from any and all liability, loss, or damage arising from or in connection with awarding, receipt, and/or use or misuse of prize or participation in any prize-related activities. Epic shall not be liable for: (i) telephone system, telephone, or computer hardware, software, or other technical or computer malfunctions, lost connections, disconnections, delays, or transmission errors; (ii) data corruption, theft, destruction, and unauthorized access to or alteration of entry or other materials; (iii) any injuries, losses, or damages of any kind, including death caused by the prize or resulting from acceptance, possession, or use of a prize, or from participation in the Event; or (iv) any printing, typographical, administrative, or technological errors in any materials associated with the Event. Epic reserves the right to cancel or suspend the Event in its sole discretion or due to circumstances beyond its control, including natural disasters. Epic may disqualify any player from participating in the Event or winning a prize if, in its sole discretion, it determines such player is attempting to undermine the legitimate operation of the Event by cheating, hacking, deception, or any other unfair playing practices intending to annoy, abuse, threaten, undermine, or harass any other players or Epic‚Äôs representatives. The internal laws of the State of North Carolina, without reference to any of its conflicts of laws principles, shall govern disputes regarding these Rules and/or the Event. Epic may, in its sole discretion, cancel, modify, or suspend the Event should a virus, bug, computer problem, unauthorized intervention, force majeure, or other cause beyond Epic‚Äôs control corrupt the administration, security, or proper play of the Event. Any attempt to deliberately damage or undermine the legitimate operation of the Event may be in violation of criminal and civil laws and will result in disqualification from participation in the Event. &nbsp;Should such an attempt be made, Epic reserves the right to seek remedies and damages (including attorneys‚Äô fees) to the fullest extent of the law, including criminal prosecution. The Event is subject to all applicable federal, state, and local laws.<br />\n<br />\n11.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Publicity<br />\n<br />\nEpic reserves the right to use the name, tag, likeness, audio, video, game play statistics, and/or Epic account ID of any player, for publicity purposes prior to, during, or after the Event end date, in any media, throughout the world, in perpetuity, but only in connection with publicizing the Event or other Game events and programing, without any compensation or prior review unless specifically prohibited by law.<br />\n<br />\n12.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Waiver of Jury Trial<br />\n<br />\nExcept as prohibited by applicable law and as a condition of participating in this Event, each Participant hereby irrevocably and perpetually waives any right s/he may have to a trial by jury in respect of any litigation directly or indirectly arising out of, under or in connection with this Event, any document or agreement entered into in connection herewith, any prize available in connection herewith, and any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.<br />\n<br />\n13.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Privacy<br />\nEpic will share information about potential Winning Players with Samsung as described in Section 2.5.2.

Crafting, Wildlife, a new loot pool&nbsp;and more necessitate an adjustment period that we‚Äôre calling our Competitive Preseason (March 16-23).</p>\n\n<p>As part of that adjustment, you‚Äôll notice your Arena Hype has been carried over from Season 5. This is intentional to give everyone the opportunity to experience the new season against players of similar Hype. We‚Äôll reset Arena Hype points for all players on March 23, at which point you can embark on your path to Champion League for Season 6.</p>\n\n<p>Based on feedback from last season, we‚Äôve also decided to make the following changes to the competitive playlists for Season 6:&nbsp;</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">Quests cannot be carried over from game to game into competitive playlists. This also blocks quests from being carried over from core playlists into competitive playlists (tentatively v16.10).</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">The Shockwave Bow has been removed from competitive playlists altogether. While the Explosive bow cannot be directly crafted in competitive playlists, it can still be found in the world.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Looking for additional details on the new season? Be sure to check out our <a href=\"https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/news/fortnite-primal-survival-crafting-guide\">Crafting Survival Guide</a> to help you get started in this new primal world.</p>\n\n<p>With all of these changes, one thing that will remain the same in Season 6 is our weekly schedule of competitive offerings. Cash Cups, Hype Cups, Friday Nite Bragging Rights, and LTM Tournaments will continue in Season 6 starting later next week.</p>\n\n<h2>FNCS All-Star Showdown (Mid Year Invitational)</h2>\n\n<p>We hinted at this last season, but we are thrilled to share more information regarding our Mid-year event, the FNCS All-Star Showdown. We‚Äôll be hosting this event on June 23-26 to give the top Fortnite players a showcase to put their skills on full display for an opportunity to earn a share of the $3,000,000 prize pool. Across the Event, players will compete in skills challenges, a non-Battle Royale team based competition, and a Solo tournament. The Event format may vary per region.</p>\n\n<p>Participation in the FNCS All-Star Showdown will be on an invite basis only. A limited number of invitations will be offered to players based on their final ranking at the end of Chapter 2 Season 5 or Chapter 2 Season 6 FNCS. Consistent final rankings with the same team across both Season‚Äôs FNCS Events will also factor in, so be sure to take that into account when deciding on your FNCS teammates in Chapter 2 Season 6! We‚Äôll provide full details on the FNCS All-Star Showdown as we get closer to the event.</p>\n\n<p>Following the FNCS All-Star Showdown, we‚Äôll take a two-week break to recharge - and you should too! Please don‚Äôt expect any competitions from June 28-July 11. We‚Äôll pick up right where we left off on July 12.</p>\n\n<p>We still have several more unique competitive offerings planned for this season that we aren‚Äôt quite ready to share just yet, but we‚Äôll be sure to let you know in the coming weeks. Until then, enjoy the new season!</p>\n","description":"This FNCS Update congratulates the Chapter 2 Season 5 Champions and looks forward to FNCS Season 6.

Epic reserves the right to seek damages and other remedies from such player to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.<br />\nThe enforcement of any applicable punishment by Epic shall not provide such player with grounds for claims against Epic under any theory of law, or otherwise be considered a liability on the part of Epic to such player.<br />\n9.2.3 &nbsp; &nbsp;If Epic decides that there have been repeated breaches of these Rules by a player, it may hand out increasing disciplinary action, up to and including permanent disqualification from all future competitive play of the Game. &nbsp;Epic may also enforce any applicable penalty specified in Epic‚Äôs Terms of Service and/or the Fortnite EULA.<br />\n<br />\n9.2.4 &nbsp; &nbsp;All Rules violations at the Event will be governed by the Epic Competitive Penalty Matrix. A final decision by Epic as to the appropriate disciplinary action will be final and binding on all players.<br />\n<br />\n9.3 &nbsp; &nbsp;Rule Disputes<br />\n<br />\nEpic has final, binding authority to decide all disputes with respect to any portion of these Rules, including the breach, enforcement, or interpretation thereof.<br />\n<br />\n10. &nbsp; &nbsp;Conditions<br />\n<br />\nThe Event is subject to these Rules. By participating, each player agrees (or, if a Minor, such player‚Äôs parent or legal guardian agrees on such player‚Äôs behalf): (a) to be bound by these complete Rules (including the Code of Conduct) and the decisions of Epic which shall be final and binding; and (b) to waive any right to claim ambiguity in the Event or these Rules, except where prohibited by applicable law. By accepting a prize, the Winning Player agrees (or, if a Minor, such Winning Player‚Äôs parent or legal guardian agrees on such Winning Player‚Äôs behalf) to release Epic from any and all liability, loss, or damage arising from or in connection with awarding, receipt, and/or use or misuse of prize or participation in any prize-related activities. Epic shall not be liable for: (i) telephone system, telephone, or computer hardware, software, or other technical or computer malfunctions, lost connections, disconnections, delays, or transmission errors; (ii) data corruption, theft, destruction, and unauthorized access to or alteration of entry or other materials; (iii) any injuries, losses, or damages of any kind, including death caused by the prize or resulting from acceptance, possession, or use of a prize, or from participation in the Event; or (iv) any printing, typographical, administrative, or technological errors in any materials associated with the Event. Epic reserves the right to cancel or suspend the Event in its sole discretion or due to circumstances beyond its control, including natural disasters. Epic may disqualify any player from participating in the Event or winning a prize if, in its sole discretion, it determines such player is attempting to undermine the legitimate operation of the Event by cheating, hacking, deception, or any other unfair playing practices intending to annoy, abuse, threaten, undermine, or harass any other players or Epic‚Äôs representatives. The internal laws of the State of North Carolina, without reference to any of its conflicts of laws principles, shall govern disputes regarding these Rules and/or the Event.

Epic reserves the right to seek damages and other remedies from such player to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.<br />\nThe enforcement of any applicable punishment by Epic shall not provide such player with grounds for claims against Epic under any theory of law, or otherwise be considered a liability on the part of Epic to such player.<br />\n9.2.3 &nbsp; &nbsp;If Epic decides that there have been repeated breaches of these Rules by a player, it may hand out increasing disciplinary action, up to and including permanent disqualification from all future competitive play of the Game. &nbsp;Epic may also enforce any applicable penalty specified in Epic‚Äôs Terms of Service and/or the Fortnite EULA.<br />\n<br />\n9.2.4 &nbsp; &nbsp;All Rules violations at the Event will be governed by the Epic Competitive Penalty Matrix.

Epic reserves the right to seek damages and other remedies from such player to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.<br />\nThe enforcement of any applicable punishment by Epic shall not provide such player with grounds for claims against Epic under any theory of law, or otherwise be considered a liability on the part of Epic to such player.<br />\n9.2.3 &nbsp; &nbsp;If Epic decides that there have been repeated breaches of these Rules by a player, it may hand out increasing disciplinary action, up to and including permanent disqualification from all future competitive play of the Game. &nbsp;Epic may also enforce any applicable penalty specified in Epic‚Äôs Terms of Service and/or the Fortnite EULA.<br />\n<br />\n9.2.4 &nbsp; &nbsp;All Rules violations at the Event will be governed by the Epic Competitive Penalty Matrix. A final decision by Epic as to the appropriate disciplinary action will be final and binding on all players.<br />\n<br />\n9.3 &nbsp; &nbsp;Rule Disputes<br />\n<br />\nEpic has final, binding authority to decide all disputes with respect to any portion of these Rules, including the breach, enforcement, or interpretation thereof.<br />\n<br />\n10. &nbsp; &nbsp;Conditions<br />\n<br />\nThe Event is subject to these Rules.

The internal laws of the State of North Carolina, without reference to any of its conflicts of laws principles, shall govern disputes regarding these Rules and/or the Event.

The internal laws of the State of North Carolina, without reference to any of its conflicts of laws principles, shall govern disputes regarding these Rules and/or the Event. Event Organizer or Epic may, in each party‚Äôs sole discretion, cancel, modify, or suspend the Event should a virus, bug, computer problem, unauthorized intervention, force majeure, or other cause beyond such party‚Äôs control corrupt the administration, security, or proper play of the Event.

In particular, players shall not engage in harassing or disrespectful conduct, use of abusive or offensive language, game sabotage, spamming, social engineering, scamming, or any unlawful activity (‚ÄúToxic Behavior‚Äù).<br />\n<br />\n8.1.4 &nbsp; &nbsp;Players shall not (a) proclaim to be, or represent themselves as, a banned player or a cheater/rule breaker, or (b) glorify or otherwise endorse the breaking or violation of these Rules.<br />\n<br />\n8.1.5 &nbsp; &nbsp;Any violation of these Rules may result in disqualification from participation (or further participation) in the Event, whether or not that violation was committed intentionally.<br />\n<br />\n8.2 &nbsp; &nbsp;Competitive Integrity<br />\n<br />\n8.2.1 &nbsp; &nbsp;Each player is expected to play within the spirit of the Game and these Rules at all times during any Event match. &nbsp;Any form of unfair play is prohibited by these Rules, and may result in disqualification from participation (or further participation) in the Event. &nbsp;Examples of unfair play include the following:<br />\n<br />\nCollusion (as defined below), match fixing or throwing, bribing a referee or match official, or any other unfair or illegal action or agreement to intentionally influence (or attempt to influence) the outcome of any match or Event.<br />\n<br />\nHacking or otherwise modifying the intended behavior of the Game client.<br />\n<br />\nPlaying or allowing another player to play on an Epic account registered in another person‚Äôs name (or soliciting, encouraging, or directing someone else to do so).<br />\n<br />\nUsing any kind of cheating device, program, or similar cheating method to gain a competitive advantage.<br />\n<br />\nIntentionally exploiting any game function (e.g., an in-game bug or glitch) in a manner not intended by Epic in order to gain a competitive advantage.<br />\n<br />\nUsing distributed denial of service attacks, swatting, or similar methods to interfere with another player‚Äôs connection to the Game‚Äôs game client.<br />\n<br />\nUsing macro keys or similar methods to automate in-game actions.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nAccepting any gift, reward, bribe, or compensation for services promised, rendered, or to be rendered in connection with unfair play of the Game (e.g., services designed to throw or fix a match or session).<br />\n<br />\nUtilizing outside assistance regarding the location of other players, other players‚Äô health or equipment, or any other information not otherwise known to the player by the information on his or her own screen (e.g., looking at or attempting to look at spectator monitors while currently in a match). For clarity, a player‚Äôs receipt of coaching or use of the in-game replay tool does not fall within this prohibition.<br />\n<br />\n8.2.2 &nbsp; &nbsp;Players may not work together to deceive or otherwise cheat other players during any match (‚ÄúCollusion‚Äù). Examples of Collusion include the following:<br />\n<br />\nTeaming: Players working together during the match while on opposing teams.<br />\n<br />\nPlanned Movement: Agreement between 2 or more opposing players to land at specific locations or to move through the map in a planned way before the match begins.<br />\n<br />\nCommunication: Sending or receiving signals (both verbal and non-verbal) to communicate with opposing players.<br />\n<br />\nItem Dumping: Intentionally dropping items for an opposing player to collect.<br />\n<br />\n‚óè &nbsp; &nbsp;Feeding: Intentionally allowing oneself to be eliminated by an opposing player.<br />\n<br />\n8.3 &nbsp; &nbsp;Wagering<br />\n<br />\nPlayers shall not (a) conduct or promote betting, wagering, or gambling on the Event or any portion thereof, or (b) benefit, either directly or indirectly, from betting, wagering, or gambling on the Event or any portion thereof.<br />\n<br />\n8.4 &nbsp; &nbsp;Harassment<br />\n<br />\n8.4.1 &nbsp; &nbsp;Players are prohibited from engaging in any form of harassing, abusive, or discriminatory conduct based on race, color, ethnicity, national origin, religion, political opinion or any other opinion, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, age, disability, or any other status or characteristic protected under applicable law.<br />\n<br />\n8.4.2 &nbsp; &nbsp;Any player who witnesses or is subjected to harassing, abusive, or discriminatory conduct should notify Event Organizer or an Event Administrator. If Event Organizer witnesses or is subjected to harassing, abusive, or discriminatory conduct, Event Organizer should notify an Epic Esports Coordinator at tournaments@epicgames.com. All complaints reported pursuant to this Section 8.4.2 will be promptly investigated and appropriate action will be taken. Retaliation against any player or Event Organizer for bringing forward a complaint or cooperating in the investigation of a complaint is prohibited.<br />\n<br />\n8.5 &nbsp; &nbsp;Confidentiality<br />\n<br />\nA player may not disclose to any third party any confidential information provided by Event Organizer, Event Administrators, Epic, or each of their respective affiliates concerning the Game, the Event, Epic, or its affiliates, by any method of communication, including by posting on social media channels.<br />\n<br />\n8.6 &nbsp; &nbsp;Illegal Conduct<br />\n<br />\nPlayers are required to comply with all applicable laws at all times.<br />\n<br />\n9. &nbsp; &nbsp;Rules and Conduct Violations<br />\n<br />\n9.1 &nbsp; &nbsp;Disciplinary Action<br />\n<br />\nEvent Organizer is authorized to make decisions regarding violations of these Rules in relation to the Event, subject to appeal to Epic and Epic‚Äôs final binding review.

By participating, each player agrees (or, if a Minor, such player‚Äôs parent or legal guardian agrees on such player‚Äôs behalf): (a) to be bound by these complete Rules (including the Code of Conduct) and the decisions of Event Organizer which shall be binding, subject to appeal to Epic and Epic‚Äôs final binding review; and (b) to waive any right to claim ambiguity in the Event or these Rules, except where prohibited by applicable law. By accepting a prize, the Winning Player agrees (or, if a Minor, such Winning Player‚Äôs parent or legal guardian agrees on such Winning Player‚Äôs behalf) to release Event Organizer and Epic from any and all liability, loss, or damage arising from or in connection with awarding, receipt, and/or use or misuse of prize or participation in any prize-related activities. Neither Event Organizer nor Epic shall be liable for: (i) telephone system, telephone, or computer hardware, software, or other technical or computer malfunctions, lost connections, disconnections, delays, or transmission errors; (ii) data corruption, theft, destruction, and unauthorized access to or alteration of entry or other materials; (iii) any injuries, losses, or damages of any kind, including death caused by the prize or resulting from acceptance, possession, or use of a prize, or from participation in the Event; or (iv) any printing, typographical, administrative, or technological errors in any materials associated with the Event. Event Organizer or Epic may disqualify any player from participating (or further participating) in the Event or winning a prize if, in his, her, or its sole discretion, Event Organizer or Epic determines such player is attempting to undermine the legitimate operation of the Event by cheating, hacking, deception, or any other unfair playing practices intending to annoy, abuse, threaten, undermine, or harass any other players or Event Administrators (for clarity, such Event Organizer decisions are subject to appeal to Epic and Epic‚Äôs final binding review). The internal laws of the State of North Carolina, without reference to any of its conflicts of laws principles, shall govern disputes regarding these Rules and/or the Event. Event Organizer or Epic may, in each party‚Äôs sole discretion, cancel, modify, or suspend the Event should a virus, bug, computer problem, unauthorized intervention, force majeure, or other cause beyond such party‚Äôs control corrupt the administration, security, or proper play of the Event. Any attempt to deliberately damage or undermine the legitimate operation of the Event may be in violation of criminal and civil laws and will result in disqualification from participation (or further participation) in the Event. Should such an attempt be made, Epic reserves the right to seek remedies and damages (including attorneys‚Äô fees) to the fullest extent of the law, including criminal prosecution. The Event is subject to all applicable federal, state, and local laws.<br />\n<br />\n11. &nbsp; &nbsp;Publicity<br />\n<br />\nEpic reserves the right to use the name, tag, likeness, audio, video, game play statistics, and/or Epic account ID of any player, for publicity purposes prior to, during, or after the Event end date, in any media, throughout the world, in perpetuity, but only in connection with publicizing the Event or other Epic events and programing, without any compensation or prior review unless specifically prohibited by law.<br />\n<br />\n12. &nbsp; &nbsp;Waiver of Jury Trial<br />\n<br />\nEXCEPT AS PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW AND AS A CONDITION OF PARTICIPATING IN THE EVENT, EACH PLAYER HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND PERPETUALLY WAIVES (OR, IF A MINOR, SUCH PLAYER‚ÄôS PARENT OR LEGAL GUARDIAN HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND PERPETUALLY WAIVES ON SUCH PLAYER‚ÄôS BEHALF) ANY RIGHT S/HE MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE EVENT, ANY DOCUMENT OR AGREEMENT ENTERED INTO IN CONNECTION HEREWITH, ANY PRIZE AVAILABLE IN CONNECTION HEREWITH, AND ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY.<br />\n<br />\n13. &nbsp; &nbsp;Privacy<br />\n<br />\nPlease refer to Epic‚Äôs privacy policy located at https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/privacypolicy for important information regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personal information by Epic.<br />\n<br />\n¬© 2021 Epic Games, Inc.

We‚Äôre planning to add a competitive preseason for one week (March 16-23) so players can experience everything Chapter 2 Season 6 has to offer and give us feedback.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, players will retain Hype from Season 5 until the conclusion of the preseason. At that point, the competitive season for Chapter 2 Season 6 will begin and everyone will be reset to 0 Hype points. Players will have at least a week to earn enough Hype points to compete in the first Cash Cup of Season 6. We will continue the Monday Trios Cash Cups, Saturday Solo Cash Cups, and Sunday LTM Tournaments from Season 5.</p>\n\n<p>FNCS Chapter 2 Season 6 will begin on April 22. As a reminder, the format will still be Trios, as it will be for all of 2021. The start date should give players plenty of time to find their Trios partners, get accustomed to the new season, and allow us to make any necessary adjustments before the start of FNCS.</p>\n\n<p>Speaking of adjustments, we‚Äôre evaluating different options for tweaking how teams qualify through Series Points, and fine-tuning scoring systems and formats for all competitive offerings. We‚Äôll share more details on the next FNCS season, along with the mid year event, soon. Until then, we hope you enjoy the rest of this season‚Äôs FNCS.</p>\n","description":"Read about the FNCS Chapter 2 Season 5 Semi-Finals seeding process and find out what is coming up for FNCS in Chapter 2 Season 6 which begins on April 22!","date":"2021-02-26T14:55:00.000Z","trending":false,"images":{"image":"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/15br-comp-3rdpartyevergreens-v2-orange-newsthumbnail-576x576-e37df0e69a37.jpg","share":"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/15br-comp-3rdpartyevergreens-v2-orange-social-1920x1080-7f0cd2b73b28.jpg","trending":"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/15br-comp-3rdpartyevergreens-v2-orange-newsheader-1920x1080-deafa5168337.jpg"},"author":"The Fortnite Team","url":"https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/competitive/news/fncs-chapter-2-season-5-semi-finals-update","nextPost":"https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/competitive/blog/epikwhale-cup-official-rules","prevPost":"https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/competitive/blog/cyprus-nell-cup-official-rules"},{"id":"c13bbcc7-2370-43c8-8109-9b0873a5c27e","title":"Cyprus Nell Cup - Official Rules","content":"Cyprus Nell Cup - Official Rules<br />\n<br />\n1.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Introduction and Acceptance<br />\n<br />\n1.1&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Introduction<br />\n<br />\nThese Fortnite - Cyprus Nell Cup Official Rules (‚ÄúRules‚Äù) govern all stages of the Fortnite - Cyprus Nell Cup (‚ÄúCyprus Nell Cup‚Äù or ‚ÄúEvent‚Äù).<br />\n<br />\nThese Rules have been designed to ensure the integrity of competitive play of Fortnite (the ‚ÄúGame‚Äù) in connection with the Event, and are intended to promote vigorous competition and to help ensure that all competitive play of the Game is fun, fair, and free from Toxic Behavior (as defined below).<br />\n<br />\n1.2&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Acceptance<br />\n<br />\nTo participate in the Event, each player must agree (or, if a Minor (as defined below), such player‚Äôs parent or legal guardian must agree on such player‚Äôs behalf) to follow these Rules at all times, including the Code of Conduct in Section 8.

Epic reserves the right to seek damages and other remedies from such player to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.<br />\nThe enforcement of any applicable punishment by Epic shall not provide such player with grounds for claims against Epic under any theory of law, or otherwise be considered a liability on the part of Epic to such player.<br />\n9.2.3 &nbsp; &nbsp;If Epic decides that there have been repeated breaches of these Rules by a player, it may hand out increasing disciplinary action, up to and including permanent disqualification from all future competitive play of the Game. &nbsp;Epic may also enforce any applicable penalty specified in Epic‚Äôs Terms of Service and/or the Fortnite EULA.<br />\n<br />\n9.2.4 &nbsp; &nbsp;All Rules violations at the Event will be governed by the Epic Competitive Penalty Matrix. A final decision by Epic as to the appropriate disciplinary action will be final and binding on all players.<br />\n<br />\n9.3 &nbsp; &nbsp;Rule Disputes<br />\n<br />\nEpic has final, binding authority to decide all disputes with respect to any portion of these Rules, including the breach, enforcement, or interpretation thereof.<br />\n<br />\n10. &nbsp; &nbsp;Conditions<br />\n<br />\nThe Event is subject to these Rules.

Epic reserves the right to seek damages and other remedies from such player to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.<br />\nThe enforcement of any applicable punishment by Epic shall not provide such player with grounds for claims against Epic under any theory of law, or otherwise be considered a liability on the part of Epic to such player.<br />\n9.2.3 &nbsp; &nbsp;If Epic decides that there have been repeated breaches of these Rules by a player, it may hand out increasing disciplinary action, up to and including permanent disqualification from all future competitive play of the Game. &nbsp;Epic may also enforce any applicable penalty specified in Epic‚Äôs Terms of Service and/or the Fortnite EULA.<br />\n<br />\n9.2.4 &nbsp; &nbsp;All Rules violations at the Event will be governed by the Epic Competitive Penalty Matrix.

Players on a team may not play Solo or Duo.

If a team qualifies for Stage 2 of the Champion Series, all three (3) players will be jointly locked to that team for that stage, and will be prohibited from participating in any additional Stage 1 matches, unless they unanimously decide as a team to forfeit their spot for that stage. If a player qualifies to Stage 2 multiple times with different teams through the Series Points advancement as listed in Section 2.5.9, the team with the higher Series Points value will be the qualified team and the team with the lower Series Points value will not be valid. In order to make the lower qualification valid, all three (3) players on the Stage 2 qualified team must submit a written request to disband by filling out the team disband form: <a href=\"https://disband.questionpro.com\" target=\"_blank\">https://disband.questionpro.com</a> before the deadline of 6:00 PM ET on February 22, 2021.

Except as otherwise expressly set forth herein, all of the Event Administrators‚Äô rights pursuant to these Rules relate to and are exercisable against the team as a whole and each individual member of the team. If any right of disqualification arises as to any individual member of the team, then the right of disqualification may be exercised against the team as a whole, as the Event Administrators may elect in their sole discretion.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n4.2.6 &nbsp; &nbsp;Earned Qualifier, Semi-Finals, or Finals qualification spots (as applicable) cannot be transferred, sold, traded, or gifted to any person or organization.<br />\n&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\n5. &nbsp; &nbsp;Issues<br />\n<br />\n5.1 &nbsp; &nbsp;Definition of Terms<br />\n<br />\n5.1.1 &nbsp; &nbsp;Bug&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nAn error, flaw, failure, or fault that produces an incorrect or unexpected result, or otherwise causes the Game and/or a hardware device to behave in unintended ways.<br />\n<br />\n5.1.2 &nbsp; &nbsp;Intentional Disconnection&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nA player losing connection to the Game due to the player‚Äôs actions.

In particular, players shall not engage in harassing or disrespectful conduct, use of abusive or offensive language, game sabotage, spamming, social engineering, scamming, or any unlawful activity (‚ÄúToxic Behavior‚Äù).<br />\n<br />\n8.1.4 &nbsp; &nbsp;Players shall not (a) proclaim to be, or represent themselves as, a banned player or a cheater/rule breaker, or (b) glorify or otherwise endorse the breaking or violation of these Rules.<br />\n<br />\n8.1.5 &nbsp; &nbsp;Any violation of these Rules may expose a player to disciplinary action as further described in Section 9.2, whether or not that violation was committed intentionally.<br />\n<br />\n8.2 &nbsp; &nbsp;Competitive Integrity<br />\n<br />\n8.2.1 &nbsp; &nbsp;Each player is expected to play within the spirit of the Game and these Rules at all times during any Event match. &nbsp;Any form of unfair play is prohibited by these Rules, and may result in disciplinary action. &nbsp;Examples of unfair play include the following:<br />\n<br />\nCollusion (as defined below), match fixing or throwing, bribing a referee or match official, or any other unfair or illegal action or agreement to intentionally influence (or attempt to influence) the outcome of any match or Event.<br />\n<br />\nHacking or otherwise modifying the intended behavior of the Game client.<br />\n<br />\nPlaying or allowing another player to play on an Epic account registered in another person‚Äôs name (or soliciting, encouraging, or directing someone else to do so).<br />\n<br />\nUsing any kind of cheating device, program, or similar cheating method to gain a competitive advantage.<br />\n<br />\nIntentionally exploiting any game function (e.g., an in-game bug or glitch) in a manner not intended by Epic in order to gain a competitive advantage.<br />\n<br />\nUsing distributed denial of service attacks, swatting, or similar methods to interfere with another player‚Äôs connection to the Game‚Äôs game client.<br />\n<br />\nUsing macro keys or similar methods to automate in-game actions.<br />\n<br />\nAccepting any gift, reward, bribe, or compensation for services promised, rendered, or to be rendered in connection with unfair play of the Game (e.g., services designed to throw or fix a match or session).<br />\n<br />\nUtilizing outside assistance regarding the location of other players, other players‚Äô health or equipment, or any other information not otherwise known to the player by the information on his or her own screen (e.g., looking at or attempting to look at spectator monitors while currently in a match). For clarity, a player‚Äôs receipt of coaching or use of the in-game replay tool does not fall within this prohibition.<br />\n<br />\n8.2.2 &nbsp; &nbsp;Players may not work together to deceive or otherwise cheat other players during any match (‚ÄúCollusion‚Äù).

If Epic and/or an Event Administrator contacts a player to discuss the investigation, the player must be truthful in the information that he or she provides to Epic and/or an Event Administrator. Any player found to have withheld, destroyed, or tampered with any related information, or otherwise found to have misled Epic and/or an Event Administrator during an investigation, will be subject to disciplinary action as further described in Section 9.2.<br />\n<br />\n9.2 &nbsp; &nbsp;Disciplinary Action<br />\n<br />\n9.2.1 &nbsp; &nbsp;If Epic decides that a player has violated the Code, Epic may take the following disciplinary actions (as applicable):<br />\n<br />\nIssue a private or public warning (verbal or written) to the player;<br />\n<br />\nLoss of session points for the current or future match(es);<br />\n<br />\nLoss of all or any part of the prizes previously awarded to the player;<br />\n<br />\nDisqualify the player from participating in one or more matches and/or sessions at the Event; or<br />\n<br />\nPrevent the player from participating in one or more future competitions hosted by Epic.<br />\n<br />\n9.2.2 &nbsp; &nbsp;For clarity, the nature and extent of the disciplinary action taken by Epic pursuant to this Section 9.2 will be in the sole and absolute discretion of Epic. Epic reserves the right to seek damages and other remedies from such player to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.<br />\nThe enforcement of any applicable punishment by Epic shall not provide such player with grounds for claims against Epic under any theory of law, or otherwise be considered a liability on the part of Epic to such player.<br />\n9.2.3 &nbsp; &nbsp;If Epic decides that there have been repeated breaches of these Rules by a player, it may hand out increasing disciplinary action, up to and including permanent disqualification from all future competitive play of the Game. &nbsp;Epic may also enforce any applicable penalty specified in Epic‚Äôs Terms of Service and/or the Fortnite EULA.<br />\n<br />\n9.2.4 &nbsp; &nbsp;All Rules violations at the Event will be governed by the Epic Competitive Penalty Matrix. A final decision by Epic as to the appropriate disciplinary action will be final and binding on all players.<br />\n<br />\n9.3 &nbsp; &nbsp;Rule Disputes<br />\n<br />\nEpic has final, binding authority to decide all disputes with respect to any portion of these Rules, including the breach, enforcement, or interpretation thereof.<br />\n<br />\n10. &nbsp; &nbsp;Conditions<br />\n<br />\nThe Event is subject to these Rules. By participating, each player agrees (or, if a Minor, such player‚Äôs parent or legal guardian agrees on such player‚Äôs behalf): (a) to be bound by these complete Rules (including the Code of Conduct) and the decisions of Epic which shall be final and binding; and (b) to waive any right to claim ambiguity in the Event or these Rules, except where prohibited by applicable law. By accepting a prize, the Winning Player agrees (or, if a Minor, such Winning Player‚Äôs parent or legal guardian agrees on such Winning Player‚Äôs behalf) to release Epic from any and all liability, loss, or damage arising from or in connection with awarding, receipt, and/or use or misuse of prize or participation in any prize-related activities.

Epic reserves the right to cancel or suspend the Event in its sole discretion or due to circumstances beyond its control, including natural disasters.

The internal laws of the State of North Carolina, without reference to any of its conflicts of laws principles, shall govern disputes regarding these Rules and/or the Event.

Scoring will continue to be a balance of eliminations and overall placement.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Format Adjustments:</p>\n\n<ul style=\"margin-left:40px\">\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">Players will compete in a single cross-platform player pool. This allows players on multiple platforms to play together as teammates.</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">Weekly Qualifiers will have an additional Round to pare down to the final lobby more gradually. See details below.&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">Once qualified to the Semi-Finals, teams will be locked and not be able to play in additional Qualifiers. This means if a team directly qualifies to the Semi-Finals in Week 1, that team won‚Äôt be able to influence Week 2 or Week 3‚Äôs Qualifiers.</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">Semi-Finals and Finals will be played out on separate weekends to better manage both player fatigue and tournament operations.</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">All prizes have been shifted to the Finals.&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">The top three teams from each region‚Äôs Finals will auto-qualify for the next season‚Äôs FNCS Finals. Note: This change requires that all three members of the team remain together during the next season.</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">FNCS Champions and other consistent top performers will earn the opportunity to be invited to the mid and end-of-year prize competitions.&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">Slightly different scoring formats for single lobby vs. multiple lobby gameplay, to account for increased level of competition and the increased challenge of obtaining eliminations in the later stages.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>FNCS Chapter 2 Season 5 Schedule</h3>\n\n<p><strong>Qualifier 1:</strong> February 11-14<br />\n<strong>Qualifier 2:</strong> February 18-21<br />\n<strong>Qualifier 3:</strong> February 25-28<br />\n<strong>Semi-Finals:</strong> March 5-7<br />\n<strong>Reboot Round:</strong> March 12 &amp; 13<br />\n<strong>Finals:</strong> March 12-14</p>\n\n<h4>Qualifiers Format (Three weeks)</h4>\n\n<p>Each week, top performing teams will progress through different Rounds of competition culminating into a 33-team field in the final stage. The top 10 teams from each region in the final stage will move on to the Semi-Finals. Series points will be awarded to teams that advanced to Round 2.</p>\n\n<p>EU Example (Check the Official Rules for your local region coming next week)</p>\n\n<div>\n<table cellpadding=\"2\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n\t<colgroup>\n\t\t<col />\n\t\t<col />\n\t\t<col />\n\t\t<col />\n\t</colgroup>\n\t<tbody>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>Friday</strong></p>\n\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t\t<td colspan=\"2\">\n\t\t\t<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>Saturday</strong></p>\n\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>Sunday</strong></p>\n\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t<p style=\"text-align:center\">Round 1&nbsp;</p>\n\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t<p style=\"text-align:center\">Round 2 (afternoon)</p>\n\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t<p style=\"text-align:center\">Round 3 (evening)</p>\n\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t<p style=\"text-align:center\">Round 4</p>\n\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t<p style=\"text-align:center\">Open</p>\n\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t<p style=\"text-align:center\">Top 1500 teams</p>\n\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t<p style=\"text-align:center\">Top 250 teams</p>\n\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t<p style=\"text-align:center\">Top 33 Teams</p>\n\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n\n<p>Additional Qualifier Path - After three weeks, the top 102 teams in series points will also advance to the Semi-Finals for a total of 132 teams in each region progressing in the tournament.</p>\n\n<h4>Semi-Finals (March 5-7)</h4>\n\n<p>Once teams advance to the Semi-Finals, they will be placed into four groups in their respective region.

Additionally, the top 3 teams from each region will automatically qualify for the Chapter 2 Season 6 FNCS Finals.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2>FNCS Prize Pool</h2>\n\n<p>With the format explained, let‚Äôs break down our plan for distributing the $20,000,000 over the course of 2021.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>We plan to have four FNCS seasons in 2021, each with a $3,000,000 prize pool, for a total of $12,000,000 in FNCS prizes for the year. The distribution across all regions for the $3,000,000 prize pool is currently based on the most recent competitive participation and regional game population. We have provided a chart below and will continue to monitor and evaluate data before each season to make any necessary adjustments.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Current Season FNCS Finals Prize Distribution by Region&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<div>\n<table cellspacing=\"0\">\n\t<colgroup>\n\t\t<col />\n\t\t<col />\n\t\t<col />\n\t\t<col />\n\t\t<col />\n\t\t<col />\n\t\t<col />\n\t</colgroup>\n\t<tbody>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>EU</strong></p>\n\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>NAE</strong></p>\n\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>NAW</strong></p>\n\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>BR</strong></p>\n\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>ASIA</strong></p>\n\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>ME</strong></p>\n\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>OCE</strong></p>\n\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t<p style=\"text-align:center\">$1,350,000</p>\n\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t<p style=\"text-align:center\">$690,000</p>\n\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t<p style=\"text-align:center\">$300,000</p>\n\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t<p style=\"text-align:center\">$300,000</p>\n\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t<p style=\"text-align:center\">$150,000</p>\n\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t<p style=\"text-align:center\">$120,000</p>\n\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t<p style=\"text-align:center\">$90,000</p>\n\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n\n<p>We also have plans for mid and end of year competitions where we will bring together the top performing FNCS players in each region in multiple competitive formats to compete for an additional $8,000,000 in prizes. We‚Äôll have more to share about these events as we get closer to the middle of the year.</p>\n\n<h2>FNCS Broadcast</h2>\n\n<p>We will be expanding our official coverage of the FNCS this season by adding separate broadcasts for French, German and Spanish speakers in the EU server region. NAE and BR coverage will continue, but we are also adding new coverage for the NAW and OCE regions. By increasing our FNCS global coverage, we can now focus our broadcasts on each previously mentioned region‚Äôs final lobby for the Weekly Qualifiers along with all Semi-Finals and Finals days.</p>\n\n<p>The FNCS OCE broadcast will be presented by our friends at the Australian Open (AO). The AO has highlighted OCE players in previous years with the AO Summer Smash featuring Fortnite. This partnership will span across all Qualifiers and into the Finals. Expect great coverage of the FNCS OCE competition, exclusive interviews, and other content that ties into the AO tennis tournament coverage in February. Stay tuned to AO social channels for more details.</p>\n\n<h2>Competitive Gameplay Changes</h2>\n\n<p>We are continually evaluating ways to adjust the competitive experience in both the immediate and long term. Our goal is to continue to make adjustments that help showcase the highest level of talent competitive Fortnite has to offer.</p>\n\n<p>The changes to competitive playlists before FNCS starts include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">Addition of Lever Action Shotgun</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">Vaulted Rift Fish</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">Vaulted Shockwave Grenades</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">Removal of Elevators and IO Guards</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">Sand tunneling will remain in competitive playlists and tournaments as long as it remains in the core playlists, as it is a major feature of this Season‚Äôs map.</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">We‚Äôve made adjustments to the amount of Bars players start with in competitive playlists. We‚Äôll continue to monitor how the Bars system fits in competitive, and will make adjustments as necessary.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>More Ways to Compete and Win Prizes</h2>\n\n<p>In addition to the $20,000,000 FNCS related prize pools, we have more ways to compete for an opportunity to win prizes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3>Solo Saturdays</h3>\n\n<p>We noted that more competitions were coming in our <a href=\"https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/competitive/news/bragging-rights-ltms-and-cash-prizes-in-fortnite-competitive-chapter-2-season-5\">blog</a> earlier this year and we‚Äôve finalized a few more. Solo Saturdays are weekly Cash Cups for Champion level players to show their skill, compete for the opportunity to win cash prizes, and potentially get on the radar of players looking to fill out their FNCS Trio. There will be intentional overlap with FNCS to provide players who may have already qualified, or didn‚Äôt make it to Round 3 of the FNCS Qualifier for that week, an opportunity to jump into a cash prize tournament.</p>\n\n<h3>More Trios Cash Cups and LTM Tournament Adjustments</h3>\n\n<p>Trio Cash Cups for Champion level players will now be every Monday, instead of every other Monday, to provide teams a consistent weekly tournament to prepare for FNCS, as well as a chance to try out a new team combination. After careful reflection and considering player feedback, the LTM‚Äôs we had previously planned to hold on the alternating Mondays with the Trios Cash Cups will now be held on Sundays to support a wider audience of participants. We‚Äôre also shifting the prize pool originally allocated to these LTMs to both the Trios Cash Cups and Solo Saturdays, and the LTM Tournaments will instead be focused on fun, no-stakes formats for the rest of the season.</p>\n\n<h3>Console Exclusive Competitions</h3>\n\n<p>We held several console exclusive tournaments last year and saw a lot of positive feedback from the console community. We‚Äôll continue to add more console exclusive tournaments in 2021 with dedicated prizing.</p>\n\n<p>We still have more unannounced competitive events coming later this Season; be sure to check in-game for our latest competitive offerings.</p>\n\n<p>See you in FNCS!</p>\n\n<p>-The Fortnite Competitive Team</p>\n","description":"Read the details about the Fortnite Chapter 2 Season 5 FNCS 2021.

Epic reserves the right to seek damages and other remedies from such player to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.<br />\nThe enforcement of any applicable punishment by Epic shall not provide such player with grounds for claims against Epic under any theory of law, or otherwise be considered a liability on the part of Epic to such player.<br />\n9.2.3 &nbsp; &nbsp;If Epic decides that there have been repeated breaches of these Rules by a player, it may hand out increasing disciplinary action, up to and including permanent disqualification from all future competitive play of the Game. &nbsp;Epic may also enforce any applicable penalty specified in Epic‚Äôs Terms of Service and/or the Fortnite EULA.<br />\n<br />\n9.2.4 &nbsp; &nbsp;All Rules violations at the Event will be governed by the Epic Competitive Penalty Matrix. A final decision by Epic as to the appropriate disciplinary action will be final and binding on all players.<br />\n<br />\n9.3 &nbsp; &nbsp;Rule Disputes<br />\n<br />\nEpic has final, binding authority to decide all disputes with respect to any portion of these Rules, including the breach, enforcement, or interpretation thereof.<br />\n<br />\n10. &nbsp; &nbsp;Conditions<br />\n<br />\nThe Event is subject to these Rules.

The internal laws of the State of North Carolina, without reference to any of its conflicts of laws principles, shall govern disputes regarding these Rules and/or the Event.
